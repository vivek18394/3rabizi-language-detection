What a shame! They have defamed Islam and Muslims.
Those people do not fear God.
We seek God's help and Support against the tyrants and the oppressors!
Hi, I am Egyptian, and he has many fans who love him, and he deserves this.
Happy new year to all Muslims everywhere.
May God shield us from these disasters.
God is Generous.
The agents have become parliamentarians and speak like this, but when you are near Israel and at the front lines, then you have a right to speak. However, the problem is sectarian.
indeed!
You are right.
The ISIS deserves this!
They indeed deserve.
May God protect Bashar and those who are with him. as for the Nusra Front, go away. whoever tries to attack the shrines, we will crush him.
Instead of fighting each other in Lebanon, they decided to move the battlefield to Syria.
Madam, I would like you to participate and I hope that you will succeed in what you want.
God knows the best.
May God protect you, Sayyed.
This is prohibited for you I swear.
Long live the Free Syrian Army
May God grant victory to the right. God is the Greatest. God is the Greatest. God is the Greatest.
I seek Allah's help. It is unacceptable for one to be a judge and an opponent at the same time. What the people of Ketermaya have done was a deliberate action, not a haphazard reaction. Why did they mutilate his body, even if he deserves more than this? At least, they should have killed him without mutilating his body. We belong to Allah and to him we will return.
Congratulations! However, we hope that you will be patriotic and provide us with correct news. We hope that your site is reliable and sincere and that you do not publish bad words of some indecent people who do not fear God.
I am with Tahra from Morocco, and she will hopefully be the star. I love you, Tahra.
UAE is great and its people are the best. I will sacrifice any thing for the UAE.
Salaam, first! Those who try to ignore the truth should consider the teachings of the Hanif religion. To those who expressed silly opinions, they should not forget that if the resistance was not there, they would not have existed. I swear, you should not be in high positions in the country. Shame on you! You sell your honor for positions. Mr. Ali Allah is not pleased with these actions neither are followers; you should use this opportunity of a lifetime.
O my God! It is cruel for you to commit such crimes against children. Those children are victims, and we are required to take a unified stance. The crimes against the young children are extremely cruel.
These are the effects of ignoring the religious culture!
Shame on them!
May God be Glorified and Exalted! Al Qaeda Organization is right and everyone doing it wrong, is doing wrong to Islam. May God prolong your life, Sheikh Usama bin Laden. Long live Palestine!
ahlawy for ever
May God have mercy upon him and provide his family with patience. As for you, Rami, you are a star on earth and in heaven. O, man, why do you say he will have the worse fate? What in the hell are you talking about?
Egypt is always the best; Shukri and Muhammad Ali will continue in the competition. May Allah help them.
Criminals!
What are you speaking about? Go and see the government sentencing an escapee.
May God never enable the oppressor, wherever he is!
My astrological sign is Libra. This is a very scary year.
You soldier, he is a minor.
I really loved you a lot, Rami. May God have mercy on you!
God is the greatest. Down with Bashar
May God have mercy on them, guys!
Are you just going to continue to talk about this stuff
Assume that this happened in your own country and against your own children, what would you do, regardless of the nationality of the murderer? I do not think that you would remain silent and take no action. However, if you couldn't make him confess, while you are sure that [he is] the killer, you will beat him to death; this may be wrong, but it is relieving. We are not overreacting or anything like that, but we defend honor and the land. If anyone accuses me of being unpatriotic, then there is no harm, dear foreigners.
The people of Ketermaya have no right to kill the Egyptian citizen on their own.
As an Egyptian, I would like to say yes for Mubarak.
I swear, God have mercy on his soul. Why didn't you tell us in the article where he was born?
I would like to say to those Jews, without entering into a useless debate, that the days of the Prophet, peace be upon him, your ancestors were Hezbollah. Hezbollah is the source of honor and pride for you and your ancestors, O mean people. Hezbollah represents the residents of southern Lebanon and it symbolizes honor in the whole world. Its youth represent the peak of respect and decency and they sacrifice their souls. This is shameful to accuse Hezbollah. Hezbollah doesn't care about any of you, and it can destroy you. You do not know Hezbollah... hahahahaha
Hi, I am Ali from Lebanon, the district of southern Beirut. I want to say that they killed him and participated in his funeral. A word is enough to the wise man.
This is prohibited. I am sure that there is a third party.
Ali Al-Amin does not deserve to have the characteristic of Sayed, because he and his followers are infiltrators, and all his talk leads to disorder.
Joumana, will you please tell me as soon as possible what is going to happen to my family and me? We have known you for a long time, but we are devastated now; please answer me as soon as possible.
Some people now consider killing a trivial issue, but they will be tormented in the hell-fire. She was a beautiful young woman, and I ask God to have mercy upon her.
Salam. I wish the gentleman would keep his disgraceful opinions to himself and go to his masters in Israel.
I love Muhammad Ali veryyyyyyyyyyyyy much.
May God have mercy upon sheikh Osama bin Laden, the leader of the mujahidin. This man had much money and he would have been able to be a personage in his society. However, he donated all his money to jihad for the sake of his religion. His wealth was no less than 300,000,000,000 dollars. I ask you by God, do you know of anyone who has donated such an amount, unless it was for the sake of God? He chose to live in the mountains, a very poor and rough life. This is the evidence of his sincerity, and anyone speaks about him must be careful because he would be held accountable before God himself on the Day of Judgment for what he said. May God have mercy upon sheikh Osama bin Laden, and we think that you were a great and sincere man. Peace be upon you….
What a picture! Seriously, it is beautiful.
Much ado about nothing.
We ask God to protect the Resistance and to protect our youth. We do not deserve anything without the Resistance.
All people know that the extremist Islamic groups and Salafis support Al-Qaeda especially in Lebanon. Therefore, Al-Qaeda enjoys wide popularity in the Arabian Peninsula in general and Saudi Arabia in particular.
Congratulations, Morsi!
No one should waste his time with folks who don't have any sense because as I said, what can you do "without any sense"
Forbidden... Forbidden!
May God have mercy on Rami and help his family.
May Allah protect them
God damn the coward terrorists!
OK
Very Good
The English song that was performed last night was very good.
May God have mercy upon you, Rami.
May God have mercy upon you.
I congratulate the members of the local council in Bani Bayyah, who belong only to the Amal Movement, particularly Ali Dib Jabir.
I believe that all drug dealers must be executed, to make an example of them. The Lebanese people cannot endure any more losses among their children and families. One day, this illegal trade will end. We want you to support the people of Lebanon, and we ask God to support us.
This is cruel.
To all those who read this message, I say: Tell all those whom you know that on the day of Friday 6-22-2012, after the evening prayer, they should stand on their balconies all over the world, and then say, "God is Greater" 3 times, "There is no God except God" 3 times, "May God punish the oppressor" 3 times, and then light a candle. The one who read this message should tell others about it, and then they should tell others too. May God bless you! May God punish the oppressor!
The article is very beautiful and is not missing anything, but the one who deserves to win is Basma
If any of your loved ones was killed, you would do even worse than that. The people of Ketermaya were real men.
Dear Rami, I hope you go to Paradise; I want you to go to Paradise. I miss you, I miss your smile, May God forgive you and have mercy upon you, Rami.
Ahmed Hilmi is the best.
What kind of picture is this?
O Lord, save us from the worst!
Thank you for this beautiful article.
Rami Shamali was wronged in his death. Poor Rami, I am Sami from Barcelona, and I say to all the Lebanese people that Rami Shamali was wronged in his death. I ask his God to expiate his sins, and forgive him and make him die as a Muslim soul. However, he died as a Christian!!!!! May You rest in peace, poor Rami!!! Samir, Tanger, and Maroc from Barcelona.
I want to understand why Hezbollah is even stepping on the head of the one who liberated this location? Hahahaha I wish you would publish my comment.
Hello. I am Bouchra from Algeria, and I love Zeina and Nassif very much, and I hope they will stay together. I also want to tell Rahma and Muhammad to stop fighting. I also want to say to Miral, you are the best girl in Star Academy, and I love you all.
This is prohibited and I feel sorry for Gadhafi.
God is the Greatest.
I do not approve of offending the Prophet.
May God have mercy upon you and admit you into Paradise. You were the best in Star Academy 7.
We should not forget Hani Ramzi, Ahmad Helmi, Muhammad Saad, the new star Ahmad Makki, and the great actor Hassan Hosni. Those are the giants of the Arab comedy.
She is the most beautiful girl in the academy…t v b
May God have mercy upon him.
May God have mercy upon the supporter of the religion and the lion of Islam. We are all Osama bin Laden and we are all enemies of the USA and Israel. The USA destroyed the minds of our youth. Go forward, al-Qaeda! Yes, yes to Al-Zawahiri.
This is the most beautiful website, it make us happy with everything.
Unrelgious and forbidden from both sides
These are mere lies, because if they wanted to find them, they would have found them already. However, these are not ordinary kidnappings, and certainly, the intelligence and the party are responsible for that. However, I wish that the hostages would be found.
Thank you
We seek God's help!
May God protect them and raise them above their enemies. May God protect our fighting Sheikh, Osama bin Laden, and grant him a long life.
This is outstanding
Muhammad Ramadan is the only star.
I am Hayat from Morocco. I am 20 years old, and I would like to thank Tahirah through this forum... Come on, Tahirah.
God suffices me for He is the Best Disposer of affairs!
Al-Qaeda does not exist. This is the fantasy of America and Israel. They are the criminals. Arabs, America is Israel. It is time to wake up, O people of the cave, O Muslims!
What is next?
I like Amro Zaki and I wish success for him.
Salam.
To God we belong and to Him we shall return. God is sufficient for us, and He is the best Disposer of affairs.
Long live Osama bin Laden!
For whoever among you worships Muhammad, Muhammad has indeed died; but for whoever worships God, God lives on forever and never dies.
May he stay where he is and may God not bless him, and I wish the same on every Egyptian who defend him. God be with every virtuous man. Wael, Lebanon, Ketermaya
They have the right to prosecute him, but they have no right to do this to him. I am from Siblin, near where the crime took place. I call on all people to be kind and civilized.
May Allah protect you.
May God have mercy upon the leader and Mujaahid Osama bin Laden, and make him among the companions of the Prophet, peace be upon him. O God! Make him drink from the basin of the Prophet, peace be upon him, because he is one of the people of the Sunnah.
Allah says, "And no soul perceives what it will earn tomorrow, and no soul perceives in what land it will die".
Indeed, he wanted to kill her because he is like a mule, while she is as beautiful as the moon. Of course, you know that they will not execute him, because we all know what the policy of Egypt is in this regard. We also do not forget Gaza and the children who are dying there, and Egypt hasn't done nothing to help them. May Allah have mercy upon her.
Peace be upon you, sheikh Osama bin Laden. You will go to paradise, God willing. All those who abuse you are infidels.
I only object!
Thank you!
It was a very exciting match. I had hoped that Al-Ismaily would win. Better luck next time!
There is no power except with God the Almighty.
What is happening right now has been planned long time ago. unfortunately, we took the bait as usual.
Al-Qaeda does not exist. All these crimes are committed by the Americans.
We are ready to sacrifice our souls in defense of Hezbollah, as it defends our lands and honor.
I really do not know what to comment on this article.
I do not blame the people of this village, because this horrible crime angered them very much. However, I would like to ask, where is the judiciary in Lebanon? I want to understand the feelings of all Egyptians, who are humiliated a thousand times every day! Why are you angry about this criminal, while you are pleased with your conditions, in spite of the fact that you starve to death in your own country? Which is the worse crime? Is it that of Ketermaya, or that of Hosni Mubarak against you? He does not respect you, and I seek Allah's help against you. However, this is natural, and you have accepted humiliation since the [time of the] pharaohs, in whose civilization you are still priding yourselves to this day, forgetting that they have been humiliating you to this day today with Hosni Mubarak. I ask Allah to depose all the Arab regimes.
The people want to go to Sharm el-Sheikh!
I will not give up!
Praise be to Allah! I got 96.46% this year and the coordination office informed me that I was accepted in the College of Engineering, Qena, and I am very happy because my father and mother are also happy because I got the damned secondary certificate!
Kak, the prime is wonderful.
I want the treat, i.e. present, of success, guys!
Very good, but I ask God to help Egypt and protect it, because this stage is very difficult. Anyway, Egypt will remain as it is, by the permission of God.
Peace be upon you…. I am Ohibi from Morocco. O God! Protect my country and king and unite the countries of the Muslims. O God! Give victory to the Palestinians over the Zionists. Amen.
Those people are merciless and irreligious.
Happy Ramadan to the world.
O God! Have mercy upon him and forgive his sins. Amen, O lord of the worlds.
I love Muhammadddddddddd onlyyyyyyy
Work for the hereafter rather than this world.
Salam alikoum. I am Majdouline from Morocco. I am 16 and I want to participate in Star Academy. If you have an idea, send me a reply to my email. Thank you.
Salam alikum. I am Ahmed from Morocco, Nador. I send my greetings to Maghreb. Blessed Ramadan. Wish you a blessed Ramadan.

very good, worth listening!...I am a Moroccan and I apologize for my writing because I am not proficient in Arabic writing. Please respond!
God willing, a caliphate in the way of the prophet-hood. May God grant victory to my brothers! By God, I have wished a lot I were with them against the infidels and hypocrites.
I'm Meryem from Morocco Oujda and we like you all namely fatin fatin fatin my greetings
These are mere words! Anyway, may God protect our king!
Salam. I love a Moroccan young man. He is married to a foreign woman. She doesn't live with him in Morocco. She is in France. They have married according to Moroccan laws. We can't marry without her consent. I live with him. I love him and he loves me. However, the family code has made things very difficult. If she comes back, what can we do? We don't have any other solution except her consent.
May God protect our country with these new rulers! We call upon them to serve the country. As for us, we are living with the power of God, exalted be He!
Curse the evil eye of Satan! Thank God!
Remember only the good deeds of your dead people. Shame on you Arabs and Muslims to kill a soul! Shame on you to play with a dead corpse! Don't forget your religion! The west is watching you. There is no other God but Allah, Mohamed is the messenger of God!
Kadhafi was a president. But he had killed many people and God rewarded him in the same way.
Honestly, I also like Clio but I don't have money to buy it!
For me, I like Renault especially Kangoo which is nice in its shape and also its speed is high.
I'm very fond of Nass El Ghiwane, I'm a young man I want to greet the Ghinawi phenomenon, I play the Bendir in a good way and I ask the officials to help Bako to come back to the group.
I'm Hamada from the village of Taouima. I sing with G-blad from Nador, the sons of my country. I like the Ghiwane more than necessary, and I sing all their songs from a long time. Batma as the proverb says (Arabi the candle of the Ghiwane died, and Boujemaa the founder of the Ghiwane.
I like Dacia Logan, it is wonderful.
Now he is better than before because now he knows how to play with music and introduced in it the eastern. Bravo Mami. You're a sumptuous singer.
What prevented opening the borders are drugs. We would welcome opening the borders, when Morocco manages to control these things.
Very distinguished!
I am a 20 years old girl. I want to know the professions which are taught at the vocational treaining centre in the town of Ksar El Kebir.
Salam. I am a Moroccan young man. I am 21. I want to enroll at the vocational training centre. They don't want to register me and I don't know why. Should I give them money or what? We always go to see them and they say come back tomorrow. I go, and there is nothing. I live very far away from Nador. I live in Tamsman, province of Nador. I hope Muslims will solve this problem for me. I will be lost if I don't study in the vocational training centre of Nador
I want help. I want to found a business.
O servants of God, people can't find even food and you are still not happy! This is odd!
Everything is good! great work!
I would like to watch the 2007 Caftan Show
Very very nice.
Many thanks
assalam alaikom . I wish Nass El Ghiouane health and happiness. Don't look back. Every horseman has a setback. Go ahead, God Help you. My greetings.
I am Amira. I love our noble messenger. I don't want anyone to denigrate him. I would like to lead Jihad for the cause of God and for him. God's curse on the wrongdoers! Salam.
Bassma is the star 2009. Come on Moroccans don't let the star make fun of you.
Hi nicest Bassma in the world. You're the star of all Moroccans. My best kisses to you and Micho.
My name is Youssef from Morocco. I love Islam and the messenger of God. I won't keep quiet about this no matter what happens. I love God and all Islam. O Lord you are capable of everything!
Shame on them! They have tarnished our religion! These aren't Muslims. These are infidels and Jews.
Salam. I am Ikram from Meknes. Everything you said, my sister, is true. Our country needs good guides. I am studying vocational training but don't know what to do. I have studied up to the bac level. All the doors of vocational training were closed. I can't re-sit the bac.
Honestly, in this country, there is no right or anything else. I have been applying for 3 years but they don't accept me. Now I have to go to sleep, that is all! This country does not help!
Salam. How are you? I am a Moroccan girl. I want to know whether I should have the bac to enroll in vocational training or not.
I am a young girl, 19. I didn't pass the baccalaureate this year. However, I would like to join you in vocational training and work promotion centers to get a job God willing! Thank you!
My name is Wuadie. I failed this year in the third year. I am hesitant whether to enter vocational training or not. Is it good or bad for my future? Please reply!
Wooooooow great, thaaaaanks.
Salam. Thanks to all the guys in the Tunisian Star Academy, Nessma TV. Thank you.
Salam. I want to know when will Maghreb star academy 2 begin? This Dounia from Iraq.
Firas, Yosra, Toraia are a fascinating group.
I love you Hamid. You are very handsome and Badr as well.
Praise be to God and thanks God! Kadhafi is dead and Libya has become free and in grace! This dog should have been killed on the first day of revolution. Many congratulations looool!
I am Marouane from Morocco. I live in Salé. I like Cheb Bilal so much. Bilal forever to death.
Hi Bilal. How are you? Aren't you going to visit Sidi Bannour, province of El Jadida as soon as possible?
A nice site
Go Zidane and fight poverty in Algeria. And you, Ronaldo, go and fight poverty in Brazil, they are starving to death. But we are living, praise be to God. We need nothing from you. We just need affection.
I hope you will provide us with news about women championship.
ooooooooohhh this is not true, I'm dying for Saida Fikri! With the will of God, I will come for you Fikri, I ask God to take a photo with her.
I want the Lemchaaheb band, if possible.
Amr Diab in Morocco, I can't believe it! I promise to be one of the fans who will warmly attend, you're the nicest singer and musician Amr Diab.
I offer my warmest greetings to the artist Amr Diab. I want to tell him that Morocco is his second country and I am one of his fans. I confirm my attendance at his concert which I consider the opportunity of a lifetime.
The cows of Meknes.
Unsuccessful fair!
Very nice, especially when it comes to Tunisia!
Salam. I am Haji from Berkane. I will go to the fair of Meknès.
Are we lacking Libyans so that we open the borders to them more than they are limited? When they came to Tunisia, they were corrupting.
This is normal, because there aren't many pitches where Moroccan youths can play. I'm one of them. I play in my neighbourhood.
Long live Algeria. It is very very strong.
This wasn't good, ok.
Hi to all Amazighs and Arabs. Long live Tassiwante. Welcome everyone
Long live Tsiwante and Agadir, I'm Karim Aoussare
You are just wasting time uselessly, may God guide you!
Stop these terrifying acts. You are in danger, help each other, brothers.
She is a beautiful artist and we love her for her kindness and humanism. A special greeting to the president of the association. I love you Haifa. I feel that we suffer of nothing.
"Kharroub" film.
Salam. Any actor, whoever he is, should not be conceited. If you are humble to God, He will uplift you.
Viva Bladen, Aazame and others would go with them! If it weren't for jihad against oppressors, religion wouldn't have spread.
Salam alikum everyone. In reality, Rabie El Kati is a well-mannered artist and acts well. I wish him more roles. I hope that you will keep up this fame God willing. I wish you success, God willing.
No more war! Let's live in peace. Let all Arab countries live and death to infidel terrorists, Christians and Jews. One day has passed, let all Arabs live in tranquility. We are all brothers. All foreigners are our enemies, let them all die! Thank you my Arab brothers!
hahahaha, thank you.
God bless you! May God protect you from the eye! I would like to say one thing, is entry to this academy based on acquaintances or performance? I am a poor guy and don't want my future to be lost. If possible, I want to register with Paradou academy.
I want "mazilon malien bilhod " (house full of love). Thank you!
Why is it that students who pass the bac without honours don't have many prospects? Aren't they also students who made an effort? This is unfair. If passing without honours offers no prospects, the minister should take a decision saying that students who have a GPA of 10 or 11 won't pass. In this way, both sides will be relieved.
Salam. I am Mohamed from the province of Azilal. Can you please provide me information about graduate schools after the baccalaureate for literature students?
In reality, I haven't found any guidance about what to major in. You have to help us; we're lost with regard to guidance about what to major in.
Hi! I want to be a nurse, but I don't know which schools I should apply to and which scores they accept in these schools. I want a reply, please!
I want a solution. My problem is that all the schools I want to attend are in other cities, not Casablanca. Is there a solution?
I am Sara. I would like to know what's after the baccalaureate, because my level is weak.
Salam alikum. I am a science student, SVT, second year of the baccalaureate. I chose this field because I love everything associated with life and the Earth, not because I have good grades. I hope I'm right in this choice. I wish everyone success!
Salam. I want please your advice. I have a bank account at BMCE bank. My monthly salary is 3450 dirhams. I would like to buy a flat with 250000 dirhams. Can BMCE give me a loan with that amount and how much will it deduce from my monthly salary for a loan of 250000 dirhams?
This is very interesting research.
Honestly, I want a good orientation from you to your sister. I study literature and don't know what to do after the baccalaureate.
Salam. Yes, well-done muslima sounia I totally agree with you. God suffices us! May God guide us and all Muslims, amen, amen!
This year in Morocco there will be many thieves as everyone wants to run for the elections.
Which constitution are you writing about? You're writing nonsense.
Salam. I have two questions if you don't mind. I need examples about subjects which a student who has studied up to the baccalaureate level SVT can do on the condition that they be approved in any field. Second question, what are coefficients of regional exam and national exam subjects which are taken by independent students in the baccalaureate arts may God reward you with good!
God bless you Badrou, I'm proud of you and like you so much, and hope that you'll be the star inchallah
Its name is the Moroccan Sahara and not Western and it will always remain Moroccan.
I love you Hajar and want you to win, inchallah, and would like to say to Soraya "what have you done to Firas, you should be ashamed!" We're Muslims not Westerners. With success to all the students.
My name is Imane. I chose the subject of technology. I hope that students who preceded us in this subject will give us information.
I heard that Hajar took the star of the Maghreb because she didn't get her rights. It is true, you are really beautiful and your voice as well.
I love Hajar so much, she has raised Morocco's head high. May God grant her success and grant success to all Moroccans including Diaa, Asmaa and Amal Al Anbari whom I love so much. Asmaa Bassit made me cry when she left and made our hearts suffer so much. May God assist Diaa and help her. We are always with her, she always on our minds. Oh Lord assist her.
Salam Hajar, how are you? You were always prominent and vigorous. You are loved by everyone. I am Adnane from Fez. Take care and do something new so that our joy is complete.
Thanks to all the Algerians and the people of Saudi Arabia for their support of Hajar Adnane. With the will of God, you are the star in spite of the envious and we are waiting for the Maghreb Star'Ac and some girl like you in beauty and prettiness.
Hi Hajar, I am from Berkane. I was happy when you came out as the star.
Are there any fans of Hamid? Shame on you. We have to see him. For me, I love him to death and his songs are nice and good. If only you creatures of God would talk to Hamid. Please, we must learn something about him and where he is because we miss his smile. Ok cry out with me so that they make an interview with Hamid. You're lucky Moroccans to have our Hamid and namely people of Tangier. Bravo Hamid, bravo, bravo.
Hajar we love you so so much, long live Morocco.
Nothing!
May God rest the soul of Kadhafi in peace! May God guide the Libyan people! Now Kadhafi isn't good!
He deserved this but they shouldn't have done this. They shouldn't have acted in the same way that he acted. I think that those who killed him are like him. What is the difference? You used to criticise him but there is no difference between you and him. By God, this is not acceptable. If he was an oppressor, why are you oppressors like him?
God's curse on those who have no shame! The lady is naked and they are talking about human rights, but where is the respect of the other?
I hail from Tunisia. I say that what happens in Morocco is a curt and pace copy of what is happening in Tunisia.
I am Otmane from Morocco. I want to know when star academy will start because I want to participate in it. I am 20, here is my phone number for a reply. Thank you.
What are you doing?
I want first of all to say to Malika who has commented above and was against Nessma I tell her that Nessma has spent the millions in order to produce the star...including the Dar, the prime, the cameras, the teachers and the artists and deserves and deserves the billions.......and I encourage it because it's Maghrebian and ridded us of the east songs and I think that Malika is a staff member of the star acc lbc
My sister is in France. She has four boys and a girl. They have a difficult life. She suffers so much with him. He beats her. He doesn't treat her well. He represses her and her children. He doesn't allow the children to play or speak. He wants his wife just to do housework and work hard at home. She doesn't go out or anything. Moreover, when she is sick, he doesn't let her rest. She goes directly to housework. He tells her you are just feigning. His sister also lives next to her. She compounds her problems. On Sunday, she wants to shower her children and go out while he invites his friends and stay up with them at home. He asks her to serve them. He insults her parents and insults her. We want a quick solution. Thank you.
There is no other god but God, Mohammed is the messenger of God.
God suffices us and He is the best mandate against disbelievers and against you in particular. O Arabs, if you really loved Mohamed, peace and blessings of God be upon him, you wouldn't have set fire on your country in order to rise up against infidels. You are just destroying your country and say we are Muslims. Spit on you!
Viva Libya!
O Lord support those who support religion and humiliate those who humiliated Muslims, amen, o Lord of all creatures! O Lord rescue us from the torture of the tomb! O Lord rescue us from the torture of the tomb!
I have long experience in the industry of cotton. The project will succeed 100%. I assume all responsibility. I ask anyone or association to buy me machines. The project doesn't require much, just 15 millions. Thanks for anyone who wants to help and trusts us. We will be with you in bad and good times.
Salam. I am Hassane. I am 34. I am technician and have professional experience. I have previously worked in Tangier. I need to work. I have looked for a job but found nothing. So I studied and have a diploma of technician. Thank you!
Peace and mercy of God be upon you. I am a young man, my name is Rachid. I am unemployed. I am a driver but I am currently unemployed. Isn't this a shame? People are working for hard work and can't find it! By God, what an era is this?
As long as there are young people who endure unemployment even if they have degrees, they need at this special moment some concern for the dear nation.
hhhhhhh, by God this is funny! I am looking for a job in France. Who will recruit you? Be a man and work in your country Morocco. You're waiting for them to call you. So wait for them to call you! There is no power and no will but from God the Almighty! There is no God but God, Mohammed is the messenger of God, peace and prayer of God be upon him.
There is nothing called work. There is just favouritism and nepotism. Therefore, Morocco is certainly going to the abyss. May God take revenge against those who robbed resources of this country! From God we are and to God we shall return!
Salam alikum. May God grant success to everyone! My dear Moroccan brothers, you should look for a job on the streets and in companies because I too am looking for a job. God doesn't disappoint me. I find job opportunities but they're not in my level as I have a primary education certificate. Therefore, I thought recently of working on my own in a private project. I don't care about its type or its cost. Even if you sell plastic bags in the market, this is not a shame. But you are not sure to collect 100 dirhams a day. A man should earn his daily income even if he would have to work on stones as I heard one man saying.
I am Sahraoui. I am proud to be Sahraoui. But I am Moroccan. This is my country and I am proud of it. We, Moroccan people, are concerned about our country, Tindou, Tlemcen and other cities in the west of Algeria must be restored one day to their mother nation. We will be tough with anyone who wants to divide the united Moroccan people from Tangier to Lagouira.
I am Algerian-African, it is ok, Morocco, it is ok, with one 1 h you're welcome here every year, you're fine.
The messenger of God says "I was sent in the hands of the Hour with the sword until God alone is worshipped. My subsistence was made under the shadow of an arrow. Humiliation and disgrace are on those who opposed me. Anyone who imitates some people, he belongs to them".
The most difficult baccalaureate exam since 2008. God is the best disposer of affairs against you!
For me, this baccalaureate was easy and there was nothing difficult. Moreover, they let them cheat, so it is offered.
Salam alaikoum, we the Moroccans are very proud of our Islamic religion. We don't approve that a Jewish woman enters the Moroccan parliament. How do we allow the Jews, after they have violated our land Palestine, to entrust them our rights and our money? The rights of Moroccan people are protected by the Moroccans, we don't need foreigners. Frankly, this is utterly unacceptable behaviour in a Moroccan party, instead of a Jew who doesn't believe in our religion and beliefs, it would be better if she were Moroccan, and could not exploit us in turn for her own interests. Thank you.
I want to know if there are any vocational trainings.
I want help with the documents necessary to join the vocational training centres. Please write to my msn.
Salam my brother and sisters. I was trained at the institute of vocational training, is one year enough? How can I continue in the future?
We have to try Jewish and Christian candidates as our Muslim deputies did nothing... Maybe good will come from the others.
Salam alikum. You have to present news as they are in reality. You shouldn't lie about what you want as a result. Salam. Viva the republic of Libya!
Is it not better for Arabs in the African continent to be united?
May God disfigure the faces of those who denigrate the messenger, peace and blessings be upon him!
Shame on you!
We Muslims must produce a film about the life of the prophet.
Great comment; very good! Thank you!
You're brainless. Is there anything to do in Morocco? The government and all its people are sleeping, and the other people are absent, as Bigg says.
Today is 3 Ramadan, it is right. Mohamed Chachou has well arrived at the Spaniards with Hamid. This is great. I am happy of the people of Sidi Lakhdar and camicaz. Long live Sidi Lakhdar and Nounou from Toulouse. Congratulations to Ismail Agade for the marriage today. This is good. I am left alone with Ahmed Mancer who loves Wahiba Malki.
Salam. How are you sons of Sidi Lakhdar? Are you well?
Akhenouch is mad!
This Morocco is changing steadily and with wisdom. There is no place for nihilists and reactionaries.
I think that he deserves the death penalty.
My darling Meryem Benmir, God bless your nice voice and your wonderful smile. You're one of those I like so much because your beauty, God bless you, you're more and more beautiful. You are also good-mannered. May God protect you, God willing! I love your northern songs because I am from there.
I address my sincere condolences to Fnaïre. I tell them, keep going. Don't lose hope. I love them madly because they represent Morocco. It is my favourite musical genre.
Salam. I am sorry for what happened to your friend. I am very very sorry for him. I ask God that you continue your path even if your friend isn't with you. From God we are and to God we shall return.
May God bless you.
May God protect men in this country! They did well to her. Any girl who goes out not respecting herself during this month of Ramadan, God's curse on her! If you see a vice, change it.
Can you answer my request please?
It seems that you want her to go out naked. That would be better, then the freedom you are calling for will be realised. We are in a Muslim country. What we see now is a shame.
What are the relations between businesses?
It seems, Miss Morocco, that I want you to sing a romantic Moroccan song.
I'm Achraf from tunisia, I love you Yaser and the film 'Wiga mich tormal' and by God we want you to progress in the cinema and God help you.
Salam. I am a Moroccan young man. I am 26. I am a member of Friendship association in the town of Kelat Seraghna. This association needs help. Thank you very much!
I'm a Moroccan woman from the city of Rabat, I love so much Hassni and I'm a fan of all his songs and wish him success in all his works inchallah.
I am a young man, 24. I would like to get your help in opening a traditional dress-making workshop. May God reward you with good! Thank you!
Salam. Does the state help 80% farmers in equipment of drip irrigation system and other equipment? Thank you. Wish you all the good!
I hope there will be a change.
Mezabites are barbarous and criminals. You just shouldn't say anything!
I hope this is true because I think Spain cannot do this favour to all Moroccan young people. Thank you!
I'm Moroccan, I love the songs of Cheb Nasro, a greeting to all the fans of Cheb Nasro.
Hi Nasro, I love the rai namely nasro, Bilal, Khalid, Hasni.
Long live Algeria, my love Mouhamed, my friends Zaki, Romaysa, Nassim and my great friends.
What I fear is this exam of the baccalaureate. I study relentlessly. I think all the time of the exam day because I sat for the baccalaureate exam last year and I failed. This year I repeat the exam. I am very scared because I already went through this experience. I hope from God to see good results this year for me and for everyone who will sit for the baccalaureate. Good luck.
I wish success to all the candidates 2009. I want assistance in philosophy and English.
Hajar deserves to win and she's our hero, and will always remain a hero, I love her so much, I'm 11 years old and I want to participate to star academy as I like it.
The title to Farid, long live Algeria!
I need help in philosophy.
My name is Rajae from Casablanca. I hope to pass the baccalaureate like all the people who were granted success by God.
Morocco forever! The best coach is Eric Gerets.
Viva Morocco! Morocco is always smart! As to those who don't like us, we wish things would turn against them! May God protect our king, our people and territory from the greedy, God willing!
Salam alikum. I would like Badou Zaki to train the Moroccan national team in order to achieve a good result. There is no other coach like him even if you make a search in the whole world. If you don't bring back Badou Zaki, may God curse you Fifa of Morocco! You understand nothing in football! Let Badoo Zaki, he understand. You stay away from football! You only want bribery. You take bribery you dogs of Morocco fifa. Anyway, God will certainly make you pay for this! Badou Zaki to death! Badou Zaki to death! Badou Zaki and his team are great!
I am Moroccan and I am proud of it. However, Taarabte should be called back. There is no player in the national league who deserves to play in the national team.
I like so much Badou Zaki. I want him to be the coach of the Moroccan national team.
Congratulations to us when Morocco toppled Algeria 4-0.
I love the national team.
I swear he is the King of Rai. I am a Moroccan guy working in Algiers. Long live Nasrou, you please all your fans! Greetings to all!
Peace upon you Aba Abd Illah, Al Hussain, upon souls which rested in your court. Peace of God from me to you forever. I cried, night and day cried, may God not make it my last visit to you. Peace, mercy and blessings of God be upon Al Hussein, upon the descendants of Al Hussein, son of Al Hussein and friends of Al Hussein.
I love national team. The African Cup will be Moroccan.
Peace be upon you sir, Aba Aabd Illah Il Houssein and upon the souls which were lost. Oh people, wake up! This is the son of the daughter of your messenger, and you are happy with celebrations? You are making these celebrations in tribute to the prophet Moussa. The messenger is for all, not just for you. You are celebrating but you shouldn't provoke Shia. By the way, hell needs wood and you're its wood.
Oh Lord take back Muslims to their religion nicely. As the proverb says: people help each other but the bald is busy combing his hair.
I am Hajar from the city of Tetouan. This year the exam for science students was a little easy. However, it was difficult in science and a little tough in English. Anyway, we wish success, God willing, to all baccalaureate students both in science and literature! I hope the correctors will be nice to us and correct well!
Salam alikum. In reality, I would like to know which types of projects they accept. Do they accept all kinds of projects or they take into consideration some criteria? Thank you!
Very nice.
I want to know how to benefit from small loans of Crédit Agricole.
Salam alikum. I want to set up a project in agriculture. I want to build a small stable, with what can I begin? I also want help. What should I do? I hope so God willing.
Viva Amar Ezzahi, he lives like a man and grew up with men! You will be entertained with Ezzahi!
Thank you very much for this very good site!
Oh God, Moroccans want to commit suicide. They haven't even committed suicide for the sons of Gaza or martyrs of Islam and want to commit suicide for a singer.
There is no other god but God. There is no power and no will but from God.
We thank all teachers of Ibn Moataz who try to help their students in preparing for the exam. I wish quick recovery to our respectable principal though I disappointed them with my failure.
It is none of your business!
I'm a student conducting research about public service. I'm wondering about the reality of the public administration in the context of the administrative reforms under way.
Woman's place is in the home. Full stop.
Salam alikum. I want, please, the official site of your agency for communication with you. May God reward you. Salam.
May God protect you my brother amar
I am one of the fans of Nass El Ghiwane to death. Honestly, this group is incomparable. I am happy to introduce to you my site for Nass El Ghiwane. Thank you.
I love Nass El Ghiwane. They are in my blood.
Why haven't you talked about the Amazigh?
I like Siham.
Morocco are all fans.
The style of EL Ghiwane, Lemchaheb, JIl Jilala, Lersad and Siham bands is my favourite musical style and will remain so forever; peaaace.
Please, we want to see them to fear being acquainted with them.
My sister Rania, I don't care about you. I like Rabie and I am right. But it seems you just stick to him. What you say is just a dream. You dream about him and want to realise it. May God protect us. Rabie is beyond your reach and can't be like you or even be with you, ok?
May God rest the souls of those who died and rest the souls of all Muslims.
Salam everyone. This is Jihane from Taza. I'm proud because I'm the neighbour of Rabie El Kati. He lives next to me in the same neighbourhood. I like his films so much. I tell him, "You're a star." The people of Taza greet you. We are proud of you.
Salam alikum. I am Amal from Taza. I live next to the artist Rabie El Kati. I like all his films. I promise you that if I see next to the door I will come and greet you. Don't be gone for too long from Taza. We miss you.
I am a student in the baccalaureate. I am waiting for results as soon as possible. I hope to pass.
I wish success to you my brothers and to me.
God's curse on you!
I want you to help me. I need orientation if there is any help. I am confused which school to choose. Please help me! I study in the baccalaureate subject of SVT.
I am a student in the baccalaureate. I don't know anything impossible. I ask God to get an excellent score in the baccalaureate exam this year.
May God deprive you of paradise!
Rachid from Tiznit. A special greeting to Hicham El Guerrouj. I hope to become like Hicham El Guerrouj, God willing!
I am very happy because I will see Hicham.
Hicham El Guerrouj is a great sportsman!
I am happy for you my sister. Congratulations to you for your success! God bless you! I wish you success in your life.
This site is quite good but we need TV like other satellite channels. Thank you.
I am an Amazigh man. I live in the commune of Taftchna in the province of Zagora. Young people in this region support everything Amazigh. Greetings to you my brothers.
Congratulations for the channel but you forgot one thing. Why have you forgotten putting an Amazigh channel, or do Amazigh people not deserve it or are they not Moroccans. Stand up brothers and set up an Amazigh channel so that people would say that Morocco has granted rights to everyone.
I am Houda. I am one of the fans of Rabie El Kati. But I want to say that Moroccan films still lack experience and even actors don't play the role in the right way. I hope you will be better. Wish you success God willing.
Salam. Thank you for this site. Honestly, there should be a channel gathering all the Maghreb countries because we need it. Our cultures are close and our languages are similar. There should be a channel which covers our films, music, news and documentaries. Thank you.
Wow, this is my first time visiting this site, God bless you.
I love everything you want, Amazighs.
Congratulations!
Breast cancer. I would like to know if I have it.
Is it possible for a woman who is breastfeeding to have breast-cancer?
In Morocco, there is a shortage in the care for sick people in spite of all statements and ads. What is the solution? For how long will cancer patients keep on dying day after day?
Peace and mercy of God be upon you. My name is Fatima. I have breast cancer and I have treated it. Now, I have the same disease but in the liver. I am very poor. I hope anyone who reads this message will help me even with prayer. I have a son who is 6. I rent a small house. I hope that benefactors will help me. God rewards benefactors. Please help this sick woman. I hope you will help me. Thank you!
I wish recovery to all sick people. They shouldn't torture themselves especially if they know that it is very costly. I wish recovery to the people of Morocco and everyone, God willing! Promise me to fight, ok!
In the name of God the most gracious the most merciful. I ask God to heal all Muslim patients. I say to all my brothers who have this disease, you can't deal with it angrily and loss of hope. You should return to the best treatment. It is holy Qur'an. I ask God the Almighty as he is the only one who can heal our sick. I wish recovery to all Muslim patients.
My name is Zoubida. I was 22 when I fell sick. My son was 3. I recovered from this disease now, praise be to God, eight years ago, thanks to God the Almighty!
Peace of God be upon you. My brothers, I need your help. My father is sick. He has liver and pancreas cancer. I want an association to help me with this disease because it is costly. I need your help to find an association to help me in Rabat. May God reward you with good!
I love you so, so much! I love you 100,000,000 times, and this is not too much for you Asala Nasri.
May God heal everyone, o Lord of all creatures!
May God heal all patients! A friend of mine feels these days a pain in the left side of her breast. I advise her to do a mammography. I ask God everything will be ok.
I'm a beggar.
Salam. I am Kamal El Messaoudi. I want the lyrics of the song Chamaa (candle). Thanks all, send it to my email, thanks.
Thank you! You have made me learn and helped me at the same time in doing my homework.
Salam. My name is Karim Dadssi. I am 18. I live in the city of Sidi Kacem. I would like to play with you, I play freely. But I can play wherever you want me to play. By God, just call me up may God protect you! By God I play very well, just call me. I play in a good free style, and have good techniques with the ball. I hope to hear from you, o Lord! I wish you success.
Thank you very much to this site and everything you do for our great Algerian singers.
When do we have to change the driving license and grey card?
Salam to our Maghreb people.
Salam alikum and blessed Ramadan. This is not Jihad, how can you kill your brother and say it is Jihad. Waw, go and do Jihad against your father and mother!
Hi, long live Maarouf Roussafi, I am a fan of this poet.
Hello, I am Rania from Tangier. I am 20 years old and live in Tangier.
So terrible, in this Morocco they want to drive us crazy with this bac!
This is a very nice site. It will help us so much, God willing! Thank you!
I welcome 100% this law,
This is a unique magazine!
02/06/2010 is the date of the national exam in Morocco. I wish success to all students. I hope that for us students of SVT, the exam will be easy. Thank you!
I had 19.45 in the bac in public schools. I want to complete my studies in France, because in Morocco, there are no good schools in terms of teachers.
The hadith says "kill the one who has no jealousy".
Salam alikum. I am very happy because I passed. On the day of the exam, I was very scared. But, praise be to God, when I passed I got 15.24. I wish success to everyone and a happy life!
I like designing dresses a lot, I find myself in that and hope from God to make progress in that.
The Sahara is Moroccan and will remain so. And if you don't like it, too bad.
Enough!
What if you claim that your license is still stamped?
I wish success in all the work you present on this site. Thank you.
I like this site!
I am a student who received the baccalaureate certificate in human sciences. I wanted to join a humanities faculty, but this choice could be an adventure. Therefore, I changed my mind. I thought of studying economics at university but is this the right choice???? Finally, planning and looking for schools are important but our future is in the hands of God. Oh Lord make things easy for Muslim youths.
I ask God to grant success to everyone in the daily life and in studies. May this year be blessed with success God willing.
May God protect us! Arabs agreed not to agree. They are all rubbish.
May God guide and grant victory to the oppressed. Besma from Tunis.
Very good work! I wish you continuity! I am preparing a graduation research project about small businesses in Morocco. I want your help.
I thank God for the independence. God is the greatest!
May God help you o brothers of Libya!
Bassma you're the star, we're with you to the end Bassoma.
Is it not a shame on them? He killed 10000 people. Haven't you seen this? Poor people, they did nothing.
My husband wants to buy a commercial store. Is there any help? Now he is leasing a store at 1500 dirhams. What's your opinion?
We have to preserve territorial integrity of Morocco. We must reshuffle ministers especially the crazy prime minister, may God heal him! Poor man, he makes an increase of 500 dirhams for people and 1000000 dirhams for himself!
I love Abdelhamid so much, I wish him to win the title of the star academy, my greetings to Farah, Hajar, Farid, Badrou and Ahmed, a kiss to Abdelhamid, I love you hamidou
Libya is on fire. Kadhafi is the man of the era. I support Kadhafi.
Praise be to God because we still hear of people like you in Morocco. Don't draw back.
From God we are and to God we shall return. There is no power and no will but from God. God is sufficient for me and He is the best disposer of affairs against anyone who spread this.
If you want, we can wage war against them.
God alone is capable of everything. O Lord protect all Muslims, o Lord, as for disbelievers, o Lord guide them to the right path.
My beloved messenger of God.
Hi, congratulations my brother Halim, unfortunately I've not played this year- God willing, next year I'll be with you.
Peace be upon you. Good show! I commend you for it but it still needs better broadcasting! I hope some serious thoughts are given to address it. Thank you.
What will happen after Kadhafi???!!!!
What have you gained? Nothing! You have a man who was protecting you, now come on to see what will happen to you!
From God we are and to God we shall return. God suffices us and He is the best mandate. There is no power and no will but from God. Where are you Arabs? Stand up to support your true religion!
I am Nihlan from Morocco. I study in the fourth year of the lower secondary. I congratulate all Algerian pupils because, God bless them, they are very brilliant. I don't say this as a compliment. This is the truth. I wish them success in their studies.
Good, good. I am very happy because the bac went well and young people were able to answer.
I wish I play with any team. There aren't any where I live. Bzou Alim from Azilal
Hahaha! Mami is free! 1, 2, 3 viva Algerians!
This album should have been out long time ago. Nas El Ghiwane star is waning, it is only a matter of time!
Hello how are you all rajawa
Ok I am a fan of Nas El Ghiwane. I am even creating a band that sings like the band.
God willing Bassma will win the title of the star academy 6.
Bassma, we are all with you. I wish you all the good. God willing you're the star. Please sing for me "Allach Ya Ghzali". Bahaa from Beni Mellal.
Bassma, I am Badr. I am Badr from Morocco. I love your songs and your sweet voice. Therefore, I want you to transmit my greetings to Maazoz, Ibra Catabra (Ibrahim) and Mohanad. I want to tell you all members of my family follow star academy 6. I tell you if I had the same age as you, I would have married you, you have all qualities. Unfortunately, I am 16. I want you to sing me a Moroccan song by Latifa Raafat. I wish you success and to all your colleagues. Thank you. bassma bassma bassma bassma bassma bassma bassma bassma
Salam. I love Basma because God willing she will be the star 6. vote for no 1. Thank you. Maryam Ifnawa.
Salam Basma. I am Maryam from Sidi Ifni. You are shining in the star 6. God willing, you will take the title. Long live Basma. Thank you.
Salam. My name is Sokayna from the city of Rabat. I don't like studying at all. I want to join you in vocational training. What are the entry conditions?
The training is very weak. We ruined ourselves when we did it. Studies are better than it is. What a condition we have reached with you!
Salam. This is a shame and disgrace for those who did it while we Arabs are sleeping.
I am a trainee in the vocational training in mechanics, Safi. This is my final year. Look, vocational training teaches practical things.
I am Mohamed. I love OFPPT because everyone works. By God, I love vocational training more than my life. It's my whole life!
I want to study vocational training, but I'd like to know the available subjects with which you can find a job. Thank you!
I am confused and need to hear your advice. I want to apply with a baccalaureate level in sciences. In which field I can apply? Please reply; thank you!
I am Wahiba. I love you so much!
I make dresses like these. If you need me, you are welcome.
Daughter of my country, you're the star! I love you so much, by God!
The Caftan is very nice. I like it so much.
The Moroccan Kaftan is a nice heritage. I consider it a treasure of our country. I like it so much and I would die for it. I always wear it. Now I hope that you will show me pictures of the Moroccan Kaftan.
I want a Moroccan Jellaba with pants. I don't like Takchitas. Like Jnins, what a catastrophe.
I like Khairi so much! I die for you Khairi! I love you so much.
I am from Morocco. I like Star Academy.
This site enables the individual to know the traditions and cultures of their countries. Thanks to this site, everything has become possible. We thank you so much, you will have all the holly reward.
Give the star academy title either to Karima or Yasmine who deserve it. Morocco never took it, please control!
I am Monsif and I have always been fascinated by the great achievements of Hicham Elgarouj.
I am very glad to hear that Algeria will make a research about privatisation and reform of the media. I hope there will be an audio-visual radio station in Mostaghanem. This is my dream for Mostaghanem. I hope my request will be met. I thank president Bouteflika for developing Algeria.
Those who don't like Farid or Badrou should from now go and sit at home.
I hope Ahmed that you'll be the star.
I love Hajar and Ahmed
I am looking for a wife.
Excellent!
Lies, these are lies.
I like Gnawa art, because it's part of civilisation.
In the name of God most gracious most merciful. In my name and in the name of all the colleagues I present with all regret and sorrow my condolences to the families…LALOUCHE ABD ELGANI..Martyr for the duty..... Yes you have gone our friend and brother, and how can we forget these days we spent together, you who always had a smile on your face, you've left without saying goodbye to us. And we will remain true to the promise, may God grant you a dwelling in His wide paradise, you're our martyr, and we're proud of you….We ask God to grant you a dwelling in His wide paradise and welcome you in paradise, and forgive your sins… And to grant patience to your family…Oh God grant him paradise…Oh God forgive his…Oh God have mercy on him…Oh God spare him the punishment of the tomb…Oh God paradise, Oh God paradise…For God we are and to God we shall return…Long live Algeria, and eternity to the pure martyrs…His colleagues KA.KB 2007.
Bassma is a star no matter what happens. She should be happy with the people who love her.
Salam. I want please pictures or videos of the region of Tabount in Ouarzazate.
Salam. Thank you for this site.
Hi. I am one of the people who love Ouarzazate. Ouarzazate is also for me the best city in the Arab Maghreb. I say to everyone Ouarzazate is open to you, Ouarzazate is not close in the face of no one. I say this in your interest and also in the interest of our Ouarzazate. I love Ouarzazate to death. No one will envy me if I go to Ouarzazate.
I am from the nice and flourishing town of Ouarzazate. Welcome to the Hollywood of Africa. You can visit it any time you want. The gates of Ouarzazate are always open with wishes of wellness and welfare. We shouldn't forget Tamazight. You are all always in the heart.
This is not acceptable. What the government did was the right thing.
Salam. I am Fatima. I am looking for a job in cooking or as a baby-sitter.
As far as I am concerned, everyone is free. We can't judge anyone since they are humans like us. We should know the main cause for this problem. However our society doesn't understand this.
We are organising this African football event. Praise be to God, Morocco is making progress, progress.
Very good and thank you
You are rambling Libyans!
May God help you, o men of al-Qaeda!
Saida Fikri is an artist who is loved by every Moroccan, young and old. Here in the Sahara, songs of Saida Fikri have become like the songs of Al Ghiwane. She is loved by everyone, old and young. A 6 year-old child knows the songs of Saida Fikri by heart. Therefore, Saida Fikri deserves all our respect. She has endured an artistic siege in her country so she chose to live abroad instead of accepting the policy of silencing tongues. Thank you very much for what you did.
By God Algerian movies are entertaining except for the grace of God.
I am a student in the second year of the baccalaureate, humanities. I don't know what to do after the baccalaureate, what are prospects I can choose? I am in a dilemma, please!
Honestly, the best one can do is completes his/her studies. But for us it is quite the opposite. There are many people who have studied, don't know languages but working. On the other hand, many people have studied and speak languages but don't have a job. Everything is just based on influential relations.
Welcome to you, in your country, Morocco. Thank you for the songs you have presented to us during these years. I love you so much more than other singers, who are unsuccessful in their songs. Thank you for everything. Kisses. Boujdour welcomes you, beauty of Morocco.
We haven't seen anything yet. Benkirane is going to take us backward. Gas has become more expensive and the cost of living has increased as well. From when he came with the Justice party, we have been going backward. He is going to make us the poorest state in the world that remained agricultural. What is behind the beard? Where does our money go?
I am a student. I dropped out of school three years ago because of family problems. I would like to complete my studies. Therefore, I will return to school next year in the baccalaureate as a free candidate. I need your support. Now I have a job. I am an electrician. Thank you!
May God curse you, hhhhhh!
Salam Hajar, how are you, you're the princess of the academy you and Hamid. Work hard, your voice is very nice, and I'm very fond of you, may God grant you success, sing to me you and Hamid a song from our country Morocco, Wassila Mohammedia.
In reality, it is better to study experimental sciences than literature.
I passed the baccalaureate this year in physical sciences. I had a score of 11.55 in the regional exam and I passed the bac without honours with a score of 11.15. I hope you will guide me to a school where I can study. I am brilliant in mathematics. Please show me some school!
Next year I will study in the first year of the baccalaureate in the subject of electricity, God willing! I want you to explain to me this subject because I want to develop myself in subjects requiring more focus.
I love you to death Hajar, Queen of the Arab Maghreb.
If I were in the Netherlands, I would have taken Dutch nationality. What has Moroccan nationality done for us? Nothing but poverty, starvation, ignorance and the gloomy future. There is no life, no future here.
Salam alikum. First of all, I would like to reply to this man whose name is 01.12.2008 who wrote these words. He said if I were in the Netherlands, I would have opted for their citizenship because his Moroccan citizenship granted him only starvation and poverty. I want to tell this man you're quite wrong. There is starvation and poverty even in the Netherlands. You don't know the value of your country until you leave it. My brother you should thank God. Thank you.
Salam Hajar. I love you, daughter of my country. Those who like Hajar vote for Hajar because Asmaa is nice to me.
Honestly, Star Academy Maghreb is a failing program, although the candidates are talented.
By God, this is inacceptable! No matter what happened, you should have referred him to justice not kill him because this is not the act of Muslims. It is only now that war will begin. It is good that Libya will belong to Obama and France is watching because you didn't use your reason. May God forgive you! You have tortured him in the last moment of his life. He was dying. This means you aren't Muslims. May God curse you disbelievers in God! Is this how Muslims act? Now be ready, they will colonize you. You deserve it because you didn't thank God, you had the best leader.
Viva Kadhafi and viva Algeria! God is the greatest o rats!
If they organise a referendum about the future coach, 95% of the results would be for Badou Zaki. Zaki forever! Morocco forever! Zaki forever!
She is a hard-working and persevering student. I wish her success in her studies and to everyone.
Congratulations to Libyans, Egypt and Tunisia!

You are beautiful like Chaos of the Senses.
Yousse Modriqe
I have a problem with my husband. I have been living with him for 12 years till I am 39. We don't have children. Still, I have endured this. I know that he has a problem. I endured his madness in happiness and sadness. He came and told me that he would divorce because my father distributed his inheritance before he died. My husband is also my cousin. I live with my aunt now because he beat me, insulted me and expelled from the house. This is why I live with my aunt. Now he wants to divorce me using the pretext of discord and wants me to renounce to all my rights and the life I wasted with him. This is because he has a house, lands, two shops and is a carpenter. He said before the court that he had nothing. I beseech you to find a solution for me and help me.
I want the address of associations fighting violence against women in Dakhla please!
Please I want the phone number of an association for women's rights. I have an urgent case.
Everything was easy 1 and 2 of the baccalaureate and even supervision in the class where I was. Several students cheated.
My name is Houda from Fès. I have a problem with my mother-in-law. Ever since I married her son, she humiliates me. I tried everything with her. She always says if you tell my son, consider yourself divorced within three days. One day, I had enough and told him about it. But he did not say a word. He was out, when he came back, he beat me then he went out. When she saw him out, she came down with her daughter, beat me and expelled me without my clothes or anything till I was surprised one day with the divorce papers. This woman wants to ruin my life while I am still young. I am only 22. Now I want you to help me may God reward you with good! Can you advise me about an association in Fès where I can seek help and which can support me? Thank you very much!!
Salam alikum. Honestly, I wish I could find someone to help me with my problem. I am 22. I have a problem with my father. Honestly, I have been living all these years silent and patient watching injustice and torture with my eyes silently. I couldn't do anything, just waiting for someone to help me. Unfortunately, I found no one. I just found people who mock and laugh at me. I can't endure any more. At the beginning, the problem was with my father and my mother. I used to see how he tortured her and humiliated her. I was silent as I said they were my parents and their problems didn't concern me. But when I grew up, my father uses me to torture my mother. This is because I grew up and I would cause him disgrace since he cheated on my mother and he thinks that since he was a cheater, everyone will cheat like him. Honestly, I can't blame anyone of them. However, o people, I can't endure any more. I can't keep on enduring his humiliation to me and my mother in front of the people while I am silent and patient. He took me out of school, I endured that silently. I said this was my father, he knew better my interest. He doesn't allow me to go out alone, I said he was concerned about me. But that he humiliates, insults and beats me in front of all the people, he deprived me of everything. He prevented me from building my future. He deprived me of living like other girls. He deprived me of everything linked to my humanity. Sometimes, I want to commit suicide but I am afraid of God Whose torture is bigger. Sometimes I say that I would leave the house, go away so that they would be relieved of me. However, I am worried that monsters prey on me and I don't want to be disgraced. I don't want my mother to go out humiliated. I am also a girl, I wish to be dignified and live with my head up. I don't want everyone to mock me. Honestly, what I am seeking is someone to help me and consider my situation. The only thing I wish is to build my future. Sorry for being redundant. However, I can do nothing. I can only write and pour my anger in writing because I have endured. I hope anyone who reads my letter extends a hand of help. Thank you very much. I am a girl from Kénitra. This is Skype.
I am looking for an association for women victims of violence. I was victim of robbery, beating and injury with white arm. This caused me a permanent scar in the face. Here is my address.
I need the address for an association for divorced women. Thank you!
I am looking for a job.
This is a good initiative. We have to inform young people about future prospects. We should not confine them to a specific field.
Salam alikum. Is it possible to help me? I am looking for a job of any kind, it should just be decent. Thank you!
If you want to work, just rely on God. God the Almighty says act my servant and I will assist you. You shouldn't lie to people!
I want a job!
Salam. I am looking for a job. I am 21. I have to work in order to complete my studies. I want any kind of job except domestic work. Thank you!
Salam. I am a young man, 26. I have a driving license B, C and E and want to work. Thank you!
Hi! Please give an opportunity to young people! You see now everyone is familiar with a field. Everyone studies. But may God guide you, that's all, to employ young people, ok! Thank you! I hope you will make more progress, bye, good work!
You're mistaken Jamal. Just look at classes or at university how many girls wear hijab and how many girls don't wear it. Then you will realize that your topic doesn't talk about Tunisia. I will tell you the same thing about Christianity, Judaism and Buddhism how opinions and religions are imposed on others. Therefore, you shouldn't talk about 1% of Tunisians or even less and make a fuss about them. There are many men who impose on women to remove hijab in order to work, this is not acceptable, and bring him money! Therefore, we can't make a topic about that and exaggerate it and make a story out of it. To your knowledge Jamal, a woman has the right to impose any condition she wants on her husband in the marriage contract. This is authorized and not contrary to religious rules. Therefore, if she wants to preserve her rights, she has no problem in this. She can impose on him to work, stay home or even set up a business for her. But afterwards, he can't refuse this. Therefore, a woman can preserve her rights and avoid injustice.
Those who don't wear hijab deserve to be stoned o brothers because it is an order from God.
I agree with you. I will do training in these fields.
Salam. I am a young man 32. I am ambitious. My advice to young women and young man who belong to poor families not to think of taking a bank loan. This concerns just a class without the other in our dear Morocco unless you are abroad, this is possible. This country doesn't believe in the skills of young people it just believes in money if you have it.
I love Wydad team to death, but when I became acquainted with a player in the FAR, I died to see the FAR in order to see him, wow.
I am from the city of Kénitra. I would like to register in a vocational training centre.
Elections are necessary but many don't deserve them, sorry.
It is an honour for women and Algeria unlike those who hide themselves indulged only in cooking and Lhaf.
Peace of God be upon you. I hope that our Moroccan team advances to the world cup because it honours us and honours the Moroccan football. I hope that the line-up of the team will be the same as the one of our former coach Zaki Bado.
I want the scores of the baccalaureate 2009 in Morocco, ok.
Oh our team, you have disgraced us just for the dirt of this life.
Why do you prefer football to basketball? Give us girls the opportunity to play.
I'm looking for training for the baccalaureate, I want to know some information.
Salam alaikoum, I want to know some information about the vocational training, thank you.
Salam. I am very optimistic but the national team is still sick. Where are you Jawad Zairi? Where are you? Football in Morocco has gone, gone.
Madjer
Pride and victory to Moamer Kadhafi! These are real men! Very odd! I say to rebels, one day you will regret the day on which you took up arms against your leader Moamer Kadhafi, the leader of all Arabs.
I like Fnaire. For me, they are the best band. I like their songs. Bahjawa forever. May God protect for us the sons of Marrakech and daughters of Marrakech. I wish success to Fnaire band in their singing career. Thank you.
I love Fnaire, Morocco forever.
Please I want to meet Fnaire and talk to them, please.
Fortunately, Earth Day celebrations will be held in Rabat!
We must defend our prophet in a civilised way.
Salam. I am Oussama. You must change Roger Lemerre.
This is no more than talk, because poors will remain that way. Thank you for your topic.
Really it is nice, I congratulate you for this article and wish you good continuation. Your brother Adnane from Casa.
I will say God suffices me and He is the best mandate. There is no other God but God.
You really need to back off, daughter! This is Morocco, not Europe. You can't use the law to tarnish our reputation. You must be respectful to your brothers!
I am a Moroccan girl. I love a Saudi young man who never married before. We agreed that he will go to talk to his family in Mecca. His father agrees but shocked him when he informed him that it is forbidden for a Saudi to marry a Moroccan woman. But why? Hasn't Islam said that marriage is based on the agreement of the parties? He is Muslim and I am Muslim. Moreover, I am not like other debauching girls. I am a university graduate and respectable. I don't want to do something to make God angry. I want to know whether this is right or no. I want to know necessary formalities to be followed and necessary papers to marry.
In the name of God the most gracious the most merciful. "They intend to put out the Light of Allah with their mouths. But Allah will complete His Light even though the disbelievers hate (it)."
Hend, I love you so much and admire you. I want to attend your wedding. May God make you happy and help you. Good luck. Amna
I want to know the balance of my account and want to know the months for which I was paid.
Salam. I have just begun work and want to know rights I have to claim from my employer. Thank you.
My dear brothers, if you want a loan, a monkey or she-monkey, you should go to the closest Moukawalati office and you will take as many loans as you want if you have a guarantee or surety by one or more individuals. By the way, these loans aren't gifts or donations, so keep this in mind! Salam.
May God help everyone!
Salam. I have a diploma in OPSM. I would like to apply for a job in a company but didn't find any offer. Please help me may God reward you with good! Get in touch with me!
Salam alikum. I am a young man, 32. I am married. I will soon have a baby, God willing! I would like to set up a business of sewing cloaks, Djellabas and Caftans. I need details about how to get a loan or funding as soon as possible. Thank you!
Salam. My name is Abdelaziz. I would like to set up a commercial project. What should I do?
I am a young man from Morocco. I am 21. I have a diploma in general mechanics polyvalent. I would like to set up an agricultural business and want to know more about that loan so that I can take it as well. Thank you.
Salam alikum. I am Mohamed from the city of Safi. I ask you this request. I want you to help me with this project which I want to carry out. It is an aluminum and wood carpentry project. My friends and I ask you for a loan. I have a diploma in carpentry. Thank you very much!
Salam alikum. I am a Moroccan citizen. I have a diploma. I applied for a loan. My application was accepted. I received a certificate from Moukawalati. Then I did a study of the project and submitted it to the bank. However, the loan request was rejected without stating any reason. Then I filed a new application to Crédit Agricole but they requested a guarantee. I gave them the deed of a land I have. However, I didn't get any reply to this day. I have been waiting for over one year. Therefore, I tell you that Moukawalati is a dream which is difficult to achieve.
First of all, we don't know if this is true or just words. Anyway, we will try to see if they really grant loans in Morocco. I tried to get a loan but can't find a solution. This is because I can't afford to pay the rate I should provide. I want to set up a transport business in Tangier. However, I don't have resources. I live abroad. I have many acquaintances in this sector. I ask God to grant me success.
This site is very nice and fascinating.
zaki zaki zaki zaki zaki zaki zaki zaki zaki zaki zaki zaki
Are none of you capable of doing sports?
Zaki forever because without him there's no national team. Thank you for Zaki 2004 and 2010 you will come back to us. Zaki forever!
Not bad!
I love Badou Zaki, I hope that he will return to the lions of Atlas. I love Soufiane Alloudi so much because he's a player who have a promising future inchallah.
To those who think that Al Qaeda organisation doesn't exist in the Arab Maghreb, I'm one of them and I say Allah Akbar (God is the greatest), the hypocrites will see what we will do, be they government or people, so fear God and you will have nothing to fear or be sad about.
These are lies and the king
First of all, I would like to thank administrators of this site because they allow us to express our opinions. I wish success to everyone. I have a problem with the subject of mathematics. Anyway, God willing, I will overcome it. The most important thing is that one makes a goal for which he/she fights in their life. This is advice from your Muslim sister. Make some goal in your life and fight for it. In the protection of God!
1, 2, 3 viva Algeria! We are always strong.
There is no other God but God. God suffices me and He is the best mandate.
There is no other God but God, Mohammed is the messenger of God. God is greatest above the tyrants!
Oh Lord help us.
I ask God this exam will be easy. I wish success to everyone.
You are very good in this site. Please more work.
Hi. I want to know a site where results are announced.
We wish success to everyone this year. Oh Lord please may I pass the bac, oh Lord. Good luck to everyone.
Happy new hegira year 1430. May God grant Moroccans and all Muslims on this occasion peace. May God remove the blockade against Gaza. God willing.
Waaaw, honestly, there are still people we can be proud of and who honour us. Honestly, I am proud of you. May God grant you success, He doesn't waste the reward of good-doers. Hasan.
Viva Morocco! We are working almost for free. May God reform! But God is great, He Who created us won't forget us even if officials manipulate us as they like. It is ok. We work 12 hours for 80 dirhams. This is a shame. 7 2011, this is a shame! Where is our future? There are some who earn 10.0000000000 dirhams a month and we earn 2000 dirhams.
We are dying without jobs and he is talking about environment and the other talks about love of the nation. In spite of unemployment and poverty, I love Morocco. They are more than liars. You're just messing up. Create jobs for young people instead of what you're doing! You're going too far with this!
Salam alikum. These are lies and calumnies about the method of Salaf. Those who committed this aren't Salafis. They are secularists.
Thank you for this decision!
Salam. I am a young man. I want to join Moukawalati programme in the field of plaster. Thank you!
Salam alikum. In my opinion, Islam is not suicide. It is the religion of forgiveness and piety. However, there are some questions. Why do these people commit suicide? It is because of the lack of jobs, suitable housing and healthcare.
Thank you for this great space!
Salam alikum. God is one. The Sunnah is one. We have to come back without fuss. Hijab is a duty for every Muslim woman who believes in God. We are guests and we need provision which we will take with us. May God guide us all!
To all those who insult salafists, or those who committed this mistake, everyone can make mistakes. However, this young girl has exceeded the limits. We are in a Muslim country and don't accept such futilities and the blind imitation of the West and Europe. We are Muslims and need someone to guide us to the right path not those who will drive us away from our tolerant religion. Please don't insult our Muslim brothers! Thank you! May God guide us all!
The girl who has no shame and who doesn't fear God can do whatever she wants. This is because she is expelling that repression inside of her through clothing. The individual should take care of himself.
I am Jamal from Spain. Salam alikum. Firstly, I think this is a good initiative and is adapted to all conditions. However, we Moroccans who are far from our countries can say this is a good initiative. Therefore, we Moroccans ask to cooperate with you.
Salam. I agree with you. We Amazigh people are marginalized by the state. We must defy everyone who stands in the face of our culture and civilization. We must struggle even with our blood if necessary. My thanks to you for your efforts. God grants success. Jamal.
It is not reasonable that the Amazigh channel remains between the sky and earth without respecting the time fixed for it. So there are hands which try not to make it come out to light. I hope that it will be concrete before others who struggle and has the right to resist including associations and that their voices will be heard. Thank you. I hope that this happens.
Amazigh channel is not Tamazight because you present Arab songs and no songs of Amazigh such as Mbark Olarbi. We hope it will progress. This is a fake Amazigh channel!
Yes, Ben Ali must be punished and more particularly Laila and her brothers. I hope they would bring Laila Trabelsi, her brothers and Zine to be executed in the Kasba.
Thank you very much for granting such an opportunity for young people like me. I hope you will find a job for me. I am unemployed. I need a job so much. I have a diploma of restaurant agent.
My mentor Amar Ezzahi is quite strong!
Wish you success!
I thank you so much for these nice articles which show you are making huge efforts to transmit them to Moroccan readers. They inform readers about important issues of interest to the public opinion. I wish you continuous success. May God grant you success.
This is not the way in which he should have been killed. He is dead. Why should they ill-treat his corpse? This is haram! Or what is the difference between them and Kadhafi? There is no difference.
Mouloudia my love to life to death, the MCA always strong.
long live Amar Ezzahi king of the Chaabi, may Allah grant him long life

I really love our Amar Zawali, he's a miracle Amar Ezzahi
Those who want to know their country and make it go forward should work in anything and make a sacrifice and should be patient so that the country makes progress, and those who want luxury should stay abroad without breaking our heads
If she had respected the instructions of Islam and if she hadn't shown her adornments - God cursed women who show their adornments and the semi-naked - people would have respected her and they wouldn't have stoned her like Satan as she was incarnating his image and body.
This is the solution Moroccans, fear God!
Hi Hajar, Hamid and Farah, inchallah one of the Moroccans a star
I like Farah, Dounia and Hajar
Salam, I wish success to everyone. Work hard ok? May God grant you success... I don't see any of you praying- why?
Congratulations for your success and wish you all success in your career!
God bless you! I wish you a great future, God willing, and to all Moroccans! My greetings to you!
Thank you for the site. Honestly Abrarou is a brilliant student. I wish her success from my heart. I can add one secret to her success, it is holding on to the strong cord of God. Thank you!
I got the best score not her! I got 19 in physics.
I wish you all the good!
I am Moroccan. I wish to know why don't you show on TV films of fkihs such as "Zaza, Li man Had Lmal". I want to say that all the sons of Oujda like it as well as films of Bila Hdoud or Haroudi. Glory be to God, they ignore nice films and present films of sick people. If you watch them you will either cry or go mad… Ayad from Oujda.
I want to know please whether Tlemcen and Oran receive the Moroccan channel with the antenna.
You are muddling.
Thanks to Amar Ezzahi, may God protect him inchallah.
If they say that Rachid is a great artist, I say that Rachid is raw talent and the origin of rai. There is no other rai but Rachid's to which I listen. God bless him.
I like the singer Rachid from the eastern region. I wish him from my heart success and fame because he deserves them. Thank you.
By God, there is no one like Cheb Bilal. Even Hasni, Khaled or anyone cannot reach the level of Bilal. He talks about the reality we live, some problems and offers solutions. By God, he is great. I listen to his old and new songs, there are no repeated or meaningless words. On the contrary, everything is interesting for us. Thank you Bilal. I hope that you will achieve more success. Moroccans, by God, love you to death. Don't care about the words of enemies. As you say, they just seek your failure, they don't want your success. I am one of the fans and admirers of Cheb Bilal. I cannot live without listening to him. I am Oussama Hakimi, Casa, Anassi 40.
I like listening to your songs you all look the same.
May God help everyone!
In the name of God the most gracious the most merciful. Our religion says that we shouldn't wish for our brothers what you won't like for yourself. How can you kill an individual and leave his children orphans? Would you accept this for your children or your relatives? May God guide us, guide you o terrorism and guide all the nation of Mohamed. Peace, mercy and blessings of God be upon you.
May God take revenge on you!
The biggest terrorism is the widely-spread corruption . Its cause is globalization. Morals have deteriorated, the good has become bad and the bad has become good. Where are we from Islam? God knows it is true.
There is no power and no will but from God the Almighty. God is the greatest. I seek refuge from God, He is the best mandate. God will punish oppressors.
Far forever, to the tomb. May God protect for us the FAR which is lifting our heads high and the Rabat fans of the FAR especially to the last day of life.
FAR forever.
Also the best singer in the world I love so much Hellani what's wrong with him?
O Libyans, you're cowards!
Salam alikum. By God, when he came he brought with him all the good. You who insult Tunisia, Tunisia is stuck, if you look at your shortcomings, it would be better for you. We say it with a loud voice: Ben Ali, all of Tunisia is with you. God willing, 1,000 years.
Hi Assi, I'm Karim Hlayel from El Majd group, I was very happy with you in Aanjar, so I wish to see you again
The symbol of Lebanon, Assi.
Salam alikum. My name is Rachid; I hope that someone will help me. I sing like Cheb Hasni.
Worthless
Man, everyone will pass God willing. I just want to explain one thing. Cheating phenomenon is a crime because cheaters are unjust to those who study. However, cheaters don't go far.
Is the star academy 2 scheduled for this year, I want a reply.
I thought the baccalaureate was in the pocket of my black trousers. But when I went to see results, I took the black trousers. They betrayed me, the back was in the pocket of the blue.
Eh Mr Karim, this is hard for us! 1- There is no infrastructure. 2- Projects of road are featured by robbery. 3- Eh Mr Karim, make a tour of national highways and you will see how they are. It is even worse in downtown. The bumps are everywhere. I don't agree. Salam alikum.
Viva the king Mohamed VI!
This is not a law and nothing else Mr minister! This will be an opportunity for corruption by police and gendarmes.
Peace, mercy and blessings of God be upon you. Actually, Morocco is lagging far behind in terms of highways. Therefore, every day about 10 people die at least according to information of the ministry of transport. This is odd. Why don't you repair roads before implementing this Swedish law? If you have decided to implement this law, you have to talk to the ministry of employment to offer the same conditions of Swedish citizens to the citizens so that law will be the same for everyone in terms of road. On the other hand, the citizens will have a job to pay fines imposed on him. Just observe Europe for example, when you drive a car, you see the road like a carpet, 2- road signs, 3- signs on the side of the road, 4- there is no corruption. Your Excellency, respectable minister, my brother, I think you have to focus on the driving license so that there will be a balance between the government and citizens. Your decision is difficult sir, respectable minister, we don't have any roads to impose sanctions on innocent citizens. May God rest the soul of someone who does a job perfectly.
This law you imposed Mr Karim is nothing because we should be developed like Europe because there is a long way in front of us to reach them.
I would like to say that there is no solution to this problem except following the paths of forefathers.
Peace of God be upon you. My question is addressed to all officials in charge of the transport sector in Morocco. Do you implement Highway Code yourselves, on senior officials in the public sector and their sons who are careless about the souls of people especially the poor? Why are complixities of bureaucracy implemented only on the working class? I call for the adoption of necessary measures because these are hideous acts and soil the image of our dear country. Salam. Thank you!
I am Rabie from Morocco. I am 14. I want to say borders should be opened. If they want war, we're ready. All the sons of Morocco will stand hand in hand and you will see.
I love you golden foot!
You have no sport spirit or anything! Why all this noise!?
I will tell you something. I am not a religious conservative and nothing. However, girls have become abundant, cheap even for free. Moroccan girls in all the world have distorted our image. May God forgive you in this life before the afterlife!
By God, this is the disease of the age. May God protect all Muslims and all the people.
Thank you for this nice site. I wish you a good continuity. Thank you.
This is a vice which they changed.
This is what she deserves.
Viva Algeria forever!
Kadhafi is dead. There are a thousand like Kadhafi in Libya. Days will show us. You will regret days of Kadhafi.
I am a Moroccan girl. I was happy when Kadhafi died. He was only good at words "house to house, home to home, street to street o rats!" Congratulations to Libya!
We want a new Maghreb.
I feel very sad for you Seif Al Islam. What is your guilt if all of Libya loves you! It is just an evil eye which affected you!
Anyone who hasn't heard Nasro is disadvantaged. Pride forever!
We beat you 4-0. We're stronger than you.
I want some modern Moroccan women.
I am a young woman from Tangier. I want to know about this event. Reply to me, OK? Thanks!
Greetings to Amazigh people wherever they are!
May God protect you, star academy is Haram and all those who supervise that are cursed. Therefore, I ask you to stay away from that. Oh Lord this is enormous…
There is no other God but Allah, Mohamed is the messenger of God.
Glory be to Allah. People are dying and you are looking for a scandal that would ruin you. Take care and come back to the path of belief. May God guide us and guide you, this all I can say.
There is no other God but Allah, Mohamed is the messenger of God. O Lord support Islam and Muslims o Lord of the worlds.
Salam. How are you. I want to tell you that there is nothing better than last year namely its beauty was compounded that year when Hajar the Moroccan took the title. It is not that I don't like others but she deserved it because she is kind.
Salam Alaikoum we're proud of this channel long live Hajar and Abdelhamid, and always Barca and Wydad Casablanca, greetings to the dear ones.
Hello Hajar. I am Soukaina from Egypt. I love Hajar so much because she is a daring Moroccan. I am Egyptian but I do not like the Egyptian. Big kiss Hajar. Bye now.
What you are doing is unacceptable. This is not a national team or anything. We want Zaki. We are not happy with this. I hope you accept this advice. You are deteriorating, oh, bye.
Salam alaikoum, my Moroccan and Arab brothers. My name is made up of four letters the first is 'W' and the last is 'A', between these letters there is my birth certificate, the conclusion before 19 years in these years there is laughing, playing, happy events and singing...And there is Nass El Ghiwane group which I love since I saw them. So I'm very fond of this group, and I don't know how to reach them. I love them and wish them every success and more productions. Wafaa from Casa. Precisely, El hay mohammadi derb molay chrife
I'm Sanae Snoussi from the city of Oujda, I like Nass El Ghiwane so much and I wish them success from the bottom of my heart. I love you madly.

Fan of Nass EL Ghiwane lover and admirer of El Ghiwane Simo
Congratulations to everyone who passed wishing the same for us, oh Lord.
We are Algerian men and we will die as men, the people can't be subdued.
I like boxing since I was a young girl. God willing I will qualify this year, ok! I am proud of all young boys and girls who play boxing.
You're a smart girl. I ask God to grant success to all students! In reality, I wish I were like you, because I'm not very brilliant I don't have an adequate environment in which to study.
Congratulations! But your general level of culture is weak. Thank you!
Is it possible to buy an apartment without making any downpayment?
I am fond of the Moroccan caftan. We are proud of the traditions of our country.
Like Morocco, very nice!
I would like to see everything associated with Moroccan Caftan.
Salam. I am Mohamed I love football. It is the most important thing in my life. Therefore, I would like to meet one of the clubs Barcelona or Real Madrid. I am now 19. I hope you will reply to this request. Thank you!
I liked this model, but there are no pictures.
This is a nice page. We all hope Morocco would take the World Cup and show its new and good face.
Salam. I am happy for the victory of my country! They shouldn't forget mistakes which they still make. But the team has to play collectively, organize its lines. Finally, I wish success to the national team. Thank you! Morocco forever!
Disabled people have rights.
If you don't bring Zaki, by God you won't do anything!
How are you? Bassma will be the star God willing. Don't worry, all Lebanon is with her.
I would like to say that everything published about the messenger, peace and blessings of God be upon him, is in favour of Islam. I hope God the Almighty will ruin anyone who wishes evil for Islam and protect the Umma of Mohammed from sedition. I am Mohamed from the city of Oujda, Morocco.
I thank you for this nice site. A nice message to Moroccans in order to know origins of traditional dresses. Thank you. I am from Khmisset. I study Moroccan design and I like to see pictures of traditional dresses. I hope to have friends in the same domain. I used to practise Moroccan embroidery. I hope to succeeded in this and participate with you.
Salam. How are you? Is there anything new or not?
My dear Brahim, I am Moroccan. I voted for you and won't vote for Bassma the daughter of my country. You're the best. I love you. I love you to death Brahim.
I hope that you will offer me a Caftan educated people.
Zaki is the only coach who can save Morocco and restore its position in the football scene.
Thank you for allowing me to write. I also agree with supporters. I want the coach Badou Zaki to come back to the Moroccan national team. I think that all lion players have lost their vitality. Though I am not expert in football, I think plans drawn by the coach Roger Lemerre are not good unlike the coach Badou Zaki. This is not an insult but just an opinion. Thank you.
I'm good at handcrafts.
My question is about how to register for vocational training.
I am Ayoub from Salé, Al Inbiaat street. I want to register for vocational training.
Very nice and interesting site!
I want to work. Thank you!
Salam alikum. I'm a Moroccan woman who lives in France. I'm following up on my studies in order to get a diploma in adult educator. I am preparing, at the same time, a study about vocational training in Morocco and problems of educators and managers. I am focusing my research on the methods of educators of managers and its impact on trainees. However, I don't have a full knowledge about the system in Morocco because I spend most of my time in France where I live. Therefore, I ask you to help me. Thank you very much. I welcome the comments of trainees and educators. Thank you! Salam alikum.
I study in the lower secondary. I would like to participate in the vocational training.
When you decide, rely on God.
What are you talking about? It is the Sahara which is left for you so that you take it! Reclaim Ceuta and Mellilla which are taken by Spain and are located in your country. If anyone gets closer here, you will see what will happen to you.
This is good but Morocco should increase its efforts a lot. Long live my country.
Hi everyone. I am Meriem. I love Jamal so much. Tell me about his news.
Everyone in this world is wishing to see his children, time passes.
I'm very proud of being a pure Moroccan and I love the traditions of Moroccan weddings and wish long life to all the brides and grooms of 2007 and wish the same for everyone inchallah. I am Moroccan, and I will keep the flag of my country up with the will of those who agree and against the will of those who refuse. Thank you my brothers.

God bless you Mr Imad. This is all I can say.
My dear Fouad, you should have used your strong mind for the interest of the country which offered you conditions to be a good citizen…Why have you wasted your future for a rumour, where's your intelligence…I hope that you will regret and repent because you don't have the right to attack animals let alone human beings Fouad.
You are most welcome! Athmane from Algiers
What I would like to say to the two governments, we are one people, we have one language. The day will come when the whole world cannot close the borders which this government is closing on its side. It should understand itself better than when others make it understand. The Algerian government understands history and knows that Morocco won't forget the Algerian people. Morocco has been standing for a long time with its neighbour and "thank you" is the best word Algerian people that know history can say.
May God rest his soul! He was a real man in his life and in his death.
I hope the news is true because he only caused us as Muslims disgrace and killing innocent saying it was Jihad for the cause of God. His only goal was to disfigure the image of Muslims and kill them. He is Sharon with long beard.
Zaki, then Zaki and no other one but Zakki.
We hope that the festival will continue forever.

This is the great confusion time for the Muslims...fear the Lord for yourselves!
Ok you know that Boutef was there when the bombings occurred, by God- these are politics. They don't let us live at all.
No Zakiiiiiiiiiiii! Michel pleeeeeeease!
The only solution is that they bring back Bado Zaki who is Moroccan and knows everything. Moreover, if they hire him, they should give him a long period so that he will be able to show the competencies of the team, at least 4 years, then we can judge!!
Congratulations Nadoura, 1000 congratulations, son of my country.
The exam is very difficult, don't worry, and pray with me so that I pass in a technical series, oh Muslim brothers God bless you, I'm Jihad Ouddida, and thanks so much, please don't forget to pray.

Long live Fnaire. Always pride. However, may God rest the soul of dj van.
I like Djeezy but I want it to extend bonuses.
I think that Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb is still present. We must fight it. Islam calls for peace and tolerance. May God protect Morocco! May God protect our king for us! All Moroccans are united. With unity, we will upgrade our country to the highest level against Al-Qaeda. I challenge anyone who says that Moroccans are terrorists. We are always in the top. May God protect Moroccans!
God is the greatest Tunisia!

Salam alikum. Concerning Saida Fikri, she is the greatest singer and greatest woman because she has succeeded in supporting oppressed people, her fight against injustice and violence against the people. This has made her attract a big audience which I belong to. Her words are very clear without ambiguity. We hope that you, Saida Fikri, go on in this sector. The Moroccan public in particular is always with you in any place.
I love you so much. I hope that they will keep on calling you to festivals. I hope that you will come to visit us in Oujda. Honestly there are a lot of people in Oujda who love you so much.
I would like to know for how long the ministry will keep on turning a blind eye to private education.
I'm happy.
Morocco is a fiasco.
Hajar and Hamid, you're the stars of the Dar and I hope to see you always together and be one hand and I hope to attend your wedding.
I love you all, and encourage you a lot, and I wish you could all win the title.

I would like to work in fruits regardless of conditions. I work hard without any results. I am ready to work very honestly. This is my phone number.
By God the Almighty, this is miserable hard work. In addition, our Moroccan brothers, when they get a position, they think they have reached their goal and act as if they own 10% in Fruit but in their procedure, they are indulgent with no one. If you are selected, bye bye! Anyway, may God reward Jabri
Can you tell me what's the salary of a lab technician?
This is not in the interests of Moroccans in general. It is the beginning of backwardness and exclusion of the language of the Almighty, which is the basis for the development and righteousness of all the people.

Salam alikum. My brothers, the baccalaureate has no value as it used to be in the past. It has become like a certificate of elementary education in the eighties. Therefore, I ask all officials to restore the value of the baccalaureate.
In order to pass, you have to work hard. As the proverb says, if you work hard, you will succeed. If you plant, you will sow. When will students compete about interesting things?
The bac is very difficult. However, one has to exert his efforts and God will assist.
I am Mohamed from Tissa. Salam alikum. I have a serious problem. I failed the bac for two years. But I don't know what to do whether to enroll again or enter as a free candidate. Now, what can I do?
I am looking for an association which can help me in the city of Settat. Please help me!

I want to know now from you: is the Middle East not enough for you, so you come to us? May God curse you.
Legislative elections are a national duty. Every Moroccan citizen inside the kingdom or beyond should go to vote even if we don't get a result for this. We are doing our duty and they have to do their duty.

I love WAC!
You Haifa will never reach the level of Elissa.
We are against terrorism in words and action because calling for Islam shouldn't be in this hideous way. We totally trust the heroes of Morocco. It is the power of the Moroccan security. We thank them for their efforts and for every drop of blood shed for this dear nation.

Thank you very much for this advice and guidance you endeavour to offer to addicted young people. Praise be to God, I am not an addicted woman but my brother is. I address my request for help if possible. Thank you very much.
I would like to set up a construction company. Can you help me? I have studied up to the baccalaureate level, experimental sciences. I am 26.

I like all the coaches and also wish all the success to the Moroccan national team. My greetings to all the players, Morocco forever.
Badou Zaki
OK, just one point, you should know those who helped you and gave to you from their own resources. It is great and helped me a lot with this topic. Thank you.
I love Nasro so much, he's nice in romantic songs.
There is no doubt that Zaki is a very good coach, but as long as everyone interferes in the business of the coach, the national team will not succeed in achieving any result.
I thank Hajar for her success and want her to produce a new album. Thank you.
I want to be a happy singer with the will of God. And since I will rely on God and you, I hope that you will guide me to which side should I go which might help me. Many thanks. Nisrine.
Azizovski, I think that you're right. A school championship and associations can be one of the positive solutions. The tournament of his highness prince Moulay Al Hassan for the schools' championships, is a good idea as well and it should be encouraged. As to those who are only good at insulting and offending, I tell them that by insulting others you show your weakness to offer smart solutions which will serve the Moroccan football.
Hajar will always be a star. Long live Morocco. Hamodi is a star. Loubna from Morocco, Meknes.
You should dismiss Henry Michel if you want to win.
Neither Hajar, Ahmad or Soraya deserve the title. It is Hamid who deserves the title of the Maghreb Star Academy because he sings well and is not selfish. He speaks four languages and he sings in all of them. Honestly, Hamid is the best one, he sings with feelings, from his heart. You're lucky Tangier people and all Moroccan people because God granted you an artist at the level of Hamid, we hope to see him.
I support the Tunisian people in everything they did. Thank you!
Salam. I am a student in social-psychology. I have a university degree. I have noticed throughout my psychology studies in recent years that my life has changed and my vision of life has become different. It is a nice subject. I encourage students to study it. I call upon officials in the ministry of education to offer job openings in this field and training sessions to train us in this field, provide competent teachers and consider courses given in psychology major.
For us the subjects weren't bad but Arabic was not understood whether it was an article or method. I was personally confused. I hope that they will present something easy in the second session to avoid that failure. As regards control, it was overcrowded; you couldn't even scratch your head. I wish success to everyone.
There is a big difference between developed countries in the educational system- especially the baccalaureate. Some candidates knew their grades even before the exam papers were corrected. Yes of course this is true, because they know who will be their corrector. May God bless the ministry.
coooooooooooooooooooooooool3
Really Mellouli you are the best. After 40 years, you are the master of Tunisia, not normal. You have honoured us.
Hi Oussama. How are you? Bless you for your big effort to make us happy. Bless you as well because you made me love swimming. But I hope to watch you one day swim, God willing. May God assist you. Fatima from Tunis.
Salam alikum. I am a follower of the issue of Moroccan Sahara which was, is and will always be Moroccan in spite of hypocrites. As for what is said by everyone, these are just plans.
I have a company without work.
Please provide me with the address and phone number of the bank!
This will only increase our love for our Lord and His noble messenger!
God is the greatest, there is no other God but Allah, Mohamed is the messenger of God.
I love you o most honourable creature! You are our beloved prophet and messenger whether they like it or not. You are the messenger of God, you are in our hearts and in the heart of every Muslim, Arab. Nothing of these vile things will take anything from our love for you. This just reflects their weakness. Peace be upon every Arab and Muslim who loves the messenger, peace and blessings be upon him.
Who is Ahire?
This is empty talk.
There is no power and no will but from God! It is the girl who went out without clothes who is mindless!
All these are just lies!
This military equipment is in good shape but do not match the superb quality Moroccan military arsenal, which is much more developed! Thanks
Bravo, it is also because they have exaggerated. There is no more shame. Thank you!
This requires good governance.
Salafists are open people. First of all, we are in a Muslim country. Therefore, she is the one who hasn't respected Sharia and provoked them with her way of dressing.
General mechanics to repair trucks.
I want a description of Emir Abdelkader. Thank you.
This is what the naked need, a ring!
I am one of the students who was a victim of the regional exam and the correction of teachers, especially the teacher who corrected my math papers. May God take revenge on the one who was unfair to me. I hope that the subjects of the second session will be up to standard.
Iman Mohamed. Is it possible to have the link of a site on the Internet, because I am researching the same topic for my graduation paper, if possible. Thank you.
O Lord destroy the oppressors!
Salam alikum. I thank you for this site, which offers an opportunity to present our problems. Thank you!
Salam alikum. I married a girl from Fez. When I brought my family for the marriage day, no one from her family was there. When I asked them, "Where were your relatives?" they told me our relatives should not know. I said to myself, they fear for themselves. I'll let this go until I take her to Spain, and I'll meet them. We spent about one month in Spain. She got her papers. We went back to Morocco for the Eid Al Kebir. She went to Fez and didn't want to come back to me. She said I wanted to divorce. I thought she was just joking until I received a letter about a divorce hearing in court. I was good to her on the day of marriage; I gave her everything she wanted. She wanted to divorce, she just wanted papers. It was her parents who encouraged her. She used to say that she was crazy for me. Once she got the papers, she began to say that she hated me. Now what does this Family Law want to achieve? Does she have the right to do this or not?
If the family law protects rights, the dignity of woman and her equality with man, it is rightful. But if in its name, man is humiliated, beaten, spat on in the face and insulted with his family, as is my case, if I but dare to speak to defend my self, the reply is: May God preserve the Family Law. By God, is there any comment?
There are no more studies in Morocco, especially in Zagora where even those who start in the 12th month can get the baccalaureate or beg for it in front of the mosque. May God take revenge.
Salam. I am Majda from Morocco. I love Bassma Boussil so much. If anyone knows her msn please give it to me or her phone number please. Bassma is a very nice girl. She reminds me of the voice of Warda. Bassma is very nice. May God preserve her and Yahia. Love you Bassma, Yahia, Khawla, Brahim, Mohamed Siraje, Mohamed, may God assist you all. Amen. I love you star academy.
Kadhafi will commit suiscide very soon.
I congratulate you. I'm asking you whether you're just really intelligent, or learn lessons by heart.
Look, even if you were first in your high school, this doesn't mean you're the first in all Morocco. This is because you're in the academy of Rabat where it is easy to get that GPA. But if you come to the academy of Meknès Tafilalte, I don't think you will get that score. Do you understand? I wish you success. I hope you will understand and accept this.
Many congratulations on getting the highest score!
Salam. 1000000000 congratulations! Wish you success! I have also passed with a score of 14.55. But, sister, don't you think of completing your studies outside Morocco? Anyway, thank God for everything! God doesn't oppress anyone. If you work hard you will pass. Wish you success, holidays would be great!
I'm very happy, because Morocco is still in the forefront in spite of its problems. I am very happy for you, my sister. I'm happy for your parents. I'm Zineb from Ouarzazate, kisses.
Very nice! Everything she said is really great! Wishing the same to us as well and take the bac this year, God willing!
Houda Abrarou is an example of hard work and perseverance, because she studied at Abi Dar Alghafari. So congratulations to this school!
We took the national exam a few days ago. I hope from God that results of the year 2010 will be positive and the pass rate high as well! May God grant us success and grant everyone success, amen, my Lord!
This sits is nice. I hope you will accept me.
Shame on you! You have drowned us in homework and revision but you say we are on holiday! So odd! Every teacher thinks he is the only one we have. Personally, I hate holidays and tell you please have mercy on us!
Salam. I am Ali from Agadir. I thank you very much for this news. OK. I hope that the Moroccan government will give some importance to these native people, Amazigh people.
Greetings my brothers and sisters. I am an Amazigh from the Netherlands. I hope that we unify our language in writing and make it the language of North African people. Greetings Amazigh people of Tamzgha.
Azul. I am Jamaa from Agadir. A greeting to Amazighs and Arabs. Thank you very much. Tanmirt.
Peace and mercy of God be upon you. I am Berber and I am proud of my Berber heritage, but we still need writing its letters, even if everything is planned. Anyway, I am proud of Berber, ahead. There are some people who don't like Tamazight but racism will not succeed in these times. Salam alikum.
How can the transitional president of Libya forget Tunisia? How could he forget that we Tunisians have helped him in their harshest tragedies?
Salam alikum. I work in the Citizen House. My comment is the following, citizens cannot pay 200 dirhams for the nursery. You should make it 100 dirhams instead. Try to find a solution will be lost and we as well. Thank you for your understanding!
Please inform us whether the hotel catering school Dar Almowatin grants a recognized diploma. I want a reply. Salam alikum.
Unemployment and poverty have dropped. Many thanks to our king for his great efforts for his nation.
Thank you, I want more.
May God guide them! This is all we can say.
Salam. I am Dounia I study in the baccalaureate in the branch of literature. Arabic exam was easy for me, they presented us free poetry, English was ok, and Philosophy moderate, they offered us history, the state and science and you must choose. Now I still have to sit for the exam tomorrow. I have geography, pray with me. I want to pass, oh Lord help me and help all Muslims. Dounia from Casablanca, 19.
Hi, there are 5 days left before the regional exam but I am still considering whether to continue cheating or not. Please reply to me.
Great thanks to you!
Hi! I study in the first year of the baccalaureate. I feel very sorry, because I was hoping to pass. Now I don't know what to do. Help me, please!
Welcome, I am looking for the contribution of Moroccans in the second war.
This site should give us all the courses of the baccalaureate.
Yes, true. The exam went on in good conditions. It was featured by transparency. There was no cheating. Teachers were doing their duty in the best way. However, Maths and SVT subjects were a little tough for me. We wish success to everyone.
I have sat recently for the exam of the baccalaureate. I don't think that the ministry knows it is incapable to put an end to cheating in spite of its aspirations to transparency and credibility in the exams. I wish success to every student in the baccalaureate success. This depends on the corrector.
The bac exam 2009 was very difficult especially the math subject. I was exhausted this year. Oh Lord grant me success.
Salam alikum. You should know the truth and look somewhere else for the truth. This is what Jews-Zionists want, the borders to be always closed and the war between the people. There is a proverb which says divide in order to rule.
May God not assist you Moroccan government, there is no power and no will but from God Almighty.
Yes, we want constitution. We want Abbas Al Fassi. We made so many efforts for you to win. We don't want you to forget us.
Morocco is a beautiful country. There are good and there are homeless eating rubbish. There are some who work for 1000 dhs and some for 15 dirhams. All this is the result of widespread plundering in our country, especially in communes and all institutions. There should be a monitoring committee. There should be no robbers. They should be like all Moroccan public servants. They are fighting this country. This is why Morocco is always dropping. But our king, may God assist him, never controls this issue.
Happy Eid!
Morocco is very bad because there is bribery.
We must respect the woman who carried us for 9 months and offer her everything that she deserves. I hope that you will like my opinion. Thank you.
Honestly, Jil JIlala deserve encouragement, good people, words which open the heart.
I want to be one of the players, thank you!
Maroc Telecom is the biggest company in Morocco but they steal money of the people openly.
Peace and mercy of God be upon you. I ask Maroc Telecom to extend its coverage to the commune of Laksabi. Thank you.
Salam. I thank Maroc Telecom for its services.
My name is Brahim, from Morocco. When Morocco is presented on Nesma I see that it is not being given enough attention. No to marginalization.
The West builds institutes and universities and hospitals and involves the people to wipe out poverty and other problems but leaves entertainment at the end. We, the Arabs, we sell rubbish and promiscuity. When are we going to wake up and progress after such long slumber! Are there any proud people oh you nation of Ibn Tachfine!
Hajar I love you so much, I'm Siham from Casa, congratulations for the title, you're a star.
I am impatiently waiting for Star Academy!
Bravo Hajar the star of Maghreb star academy, don't forget your friends.
Hi, how are you, I'm Mohssine, I love so much the star academy, it's really the star of all countries.
I like to listen to the words of the Moroccan squad in the world or Africa. However, in recent years, we have noticed a team totally incapable of achieving positive results. I hope that the federation recalls the coach Badou Zaki. He is the only one who can realize the hopes of the Moroccan fans in general; I say it with my head up and with audacity. We totally trust Zaki. Thank you.
Hi everyone, I really love Djamel, he's great, a kiss, I love you so much.
Hi Haifa! I love you very much. Please know that you are the best singer. I love you!
Salam. I am Wafa. I graduated from ISAMK. I like mosaic. I wish you would give me the addresses of mosaic workshops. Thank you!
Yes, I love Gnawa. Every year I go to Essaouira. What is the date of Essaouira festival? It's 22/06/2010?
Gnaoua
Very beautiful.
Where is the film denigrating the messenger?
God is sufficient for me and He is the best disposer of affairs against you dogs. There is no other God but Allah, Mohamed is the messenger of Allah.
There is no other God but Allah, Mohamed is the messenger of God. God is sufficient for us and He is the best disposer of affairs. May God take revenge against you!
Why have they done this?
I want to prosper more in the field of business in order to invest in Morocco. Thank you for your interest.
Everyone is speaking his language! May God guide the Libyan people because protests aren't in the interest of Libya.
Viva Kadhafi in spite of traitorous rebels.
good work farid, jamal, badro, hamid, you again we've put you, you're the son of the country Alge
Salam alikum my brothers and sisters. I am happy for Libya because it was liberated but not in this way because he is a human being. They should have let him be punished by the Libyan police. By God, I was sick to see him killed in this way! Thank you!
Long live Algeria my country, if you have a problem.
Algeria will win over Egypt God willing.
Oh Satan, the fate of you and your colleagues is to hell.
All these are lies and hypocrisy.
Algeria and Egypt will make a draw. Egypt is a very strong team.
I'm a friend of Nass El Ghiwane group and a relative of Boujmi.
I want the songs of Nass.
Congratulations, even if it is not from my heart because I love you and would die for you! But I will wait for you, even if I will be your fourth wife! By God, I love you so much!
Salam alikum. I have been asking for so long about the number of points I have.
I don't know from where you come up with such extremist ideas. Niqab was never imposed in the Islamic religion. It is not stated neither in the tradition of the prophet nor in Qur'an.
I want to know the number of days.
Nice
The minister Ghalleb is sick in his head, may God heal him!
Hi, Yassin Ahjam. I love your personality so much and I wish you happiness with your wife. Happy New Year! Wishing you all the best for the New Year.
Hi. I am also a designer. If you want nice designs, call me.
Is there a possibility to help the promising talents!
I love Nass Al Ghiwane and dream to sing like them!
I love the Moroccan Caftan.
Thanks to all artists!
O Lord grant victory to Islam and Muslims amen o Lord of the worlds!
Viva Algeria! Viva Morocco! You're welcome in Annaba, we welcome you very warmly by God!
The messenger of God is the most honourable and purest creature of God. We will sacrifice our lives for you, o messenger of God.
Tunisia is going into a wall.
You say the coach should be Moroccan because the European has no concern for the country. This is false. Why has Guus Hidding the Dutch coach helped Korea almost reach the final? Why has Henry Michel made Morocco reach the second round and Jose Faria...? Once we lose the first match we sack the coach. This is a mistake. We have no strong local team. We lost the last match 2-0 against Cameroon. Since we opened our eyes, we only hear about Mostafa Haji; Haji went and Yousef Haji came. Wait for Haji Kadour, Hamad Haji to come. We will just keep on remembering tales. We have players who can bring the World Cup, but where is the interest they need? Officials in the federation should be experts in football. Some don't know even rules of the game and we appoint them to the federation. This is a shame; look at our current situation. Now we are scared even by Mauritania, unless we lose to them. By God, we really cried when we were disqualified from the World Cup and the African Cup. We also want to revel and go into the streets, scream, go mad and celebrate our players, our nation and our flag. Our king is a sportsman, may God assist him and protect him for us, always lifting our heads in Europe. We are proud of Morocco and our dear flag, which we die for. My love for the nation made me write this. I love Morocco from Tangier to Lagouira.
I am Kamal Settoh. I did training in hair-dressing. I am looking for a job.
I have reached the second year of the baccalaureate. Now I am pursuing my studies at a private vocational training school. What do you think of this?
This is good but the branch of OPS is good in Taourirt.
I want to register. I am Said from Zagora.
I want to register for vocational training but they rejected me. They always tell me "go away until tomorrow". But those who give money are accepted.
God is sufficient for me and He is the best disposer of affairs. By God, this is an injustice against us. We all hope justice will prevail. Thank you!
Hi Nessma. I hope that our channel introduces Wana line because they only use Meditel and Itissalat. Where is Wana? We also want to communicate with Nessma. We hope that you transmit to us the songs of Hajar Adnane. I love you Nessma.
Thank you very much. Ok, thank you very much, ok.
I am very happy for the victory of Hajar. I am very glad, I send a kiss to Mohamed. I love you, bye, bye.
Ariyadia is really great.
Man, everyone has to change so we can get rid of this disturbance.
It is normal that we cheat. We are forced to do this.
We would like to see the second edition of Starac Maghreb as soon as possible.
We love Farid so much because he sings very well and is very young.
There is no one like Cheb Hesni. He has shown us the real Rai.
The whole life is the locomotive of the human being
Yes, Polisaro front is terrorist! Ould Salk said the front is fighting hideous crimes. This is just a form of bouncing backward. What have you done in Laayoune? Weren't they crimes? The Algerian government and the separatist organization is the biggest war criminal! I say to the Algerian people that your rulers hail from the Moroccan city Oujda. So do you accept to be ruled by outlaw men we have expelled?
Salam alikum. I am wondering about the names of actors.
Thank you for your good article, I benefited a lot
Nadoura, I am from Soussa. I love you so much, you, Zaher, and Amel Bouchoucha. I hate Kweider. It is not normal. This creature must have a complication. What he thinks he is 5555? Nader you are a star and will always remain a star in our hearts over the heads. All the people like you. Those who don't like you are just jealous. I love you Nader since the first time I saw you in the star academy and the first time I vote for you. Praise be to God. Finally, right come up. Long live Nader.
Honestly and in a few words, people who don't respect this holy month have no religion at all. God is angry with them in this life and in the afterlife. Curse them! I ask God the Almighty to guide everyone!
Salam alaikoum. I am a Moroccan woman. I hope the border will be opened. I love someone in Algeria, I want to see him.
I love you Rabie El Kati. I love you so much. My wish is to meet you. I love you.
They have to be punished. It is good if you arrest them one by one. They are serious. Please, arrest him, please, ok, help me!
May God support the right!
Salam alikum. I love sheikh Amar Ezzahi and sheikhs of popular music.
Let's be optimistic and let the new government follow its plan. Times will show us secrets of the physics professor Benkirane.
I am from Algiers. I want to be informed about handball.
The Sahara is Moroccan and will always be Moroccan. Will raise a red and green flag to the end of the world. It's our nation and we're always ready to defend our country and our Sahara. Allah, the nation and the king. The Sahara is Moroccan.
I hope you will all win.
I love you Hamid, I love you so much, you and Hajer God help you.
Hi, I'm Sanaa from Morocco, I love you all and inchallah Hamid or Hajar the star of the academy, thank you.
Salam alikum. I passed the baccalaureate this year in Sciences of Life and Earth. I would like to study economic sciences at university. So is it possible for me to study it? Please reply as soon as possible!
I liked so much this comment, ok, bye, salam to all the family, bye bye my love.
salam alaikoum, I don't want your comment.
To say the truth, a woman who reveals her body when she goes out from home really deserves this. For me, this is not enough for her. I prefer that she is stoned because our country is a Muslim country. There is no freedom of clothing as some think. Religion hasn't told us to do what we want. Everything has limits. Revealing body has deep impacts at many levels. O people, fear God, there is nothing called individual freedom.
Chaouchi will be present God willing and in good health. May God heal Gaouaoui God willing.
Greetings to you my brothers and sisters, we the Amazigh people have established the Amazigh, the Watassn have gone, and even if they have gone they'll come back, and if they don't come back, we'll come back, it's not me who says that, anyone who cheats Imazighen we trust, greetings.
Hi, women need affection and care.
Salam alikum. We haven't seen anything. I have been unemployed for four years. We haven't seen anything except words. Excuse me, my heart is in pain.
Salam. I am Younes. I am replying to those who say the baccalaureate is worthless as people pass by cheating and that they just seek the baccalaureate degree in order to enroll in graduate studies. I say that people who pass the baccalaureate with a score of 13 and 14 should work hard. People should forget the idea of taking the baccalaureate and staying home.
The baccalaureate is idle with an idle ministry.
You only have to be patient young girl, God will solve everything soon.
All poor people don't have the right to education because corruption is widely-spread in our country. I say to all students, thank you! Seek the help of God!
Salam. I am Sara. My brother is looking for a job as a driver. He is 30. Please help me may God reward you with all the good!
Do your lies not stop? Only hypocrisy and lies while young people are lost. Why do you make us waste our time in studies? Since there are no jobs, we should learn a job better from the beginning so that we wouldn't be a burden for society.
Oh enemy, help students of the bac!
Shame on you! I have been going to ANAPEC for 2 years. We have done a training session with them. They told us that we would work later but we haven't seen anything! This is the truth about ANAPEC.
I am looking for a job in the fields. I have a degree in computer science and a degree in nursing.
I see well, but I want to report the case of drugs which is increasing and spreading at a high speed among runners all over the kingdom. The problem also touches members of the national team and they go with it to the podium.
I want a job. I am a pastry-cook. I want any job, it just have to be legitimate.
I am a young man, 22. I want to set up a building business. I want help, even if it's just moral support.
My comment is the following. As long as people in charge of high positions in companies in general are incompetent and below required level, there will be no jobs for workers in their special field. Therefore, there will be no production and thus the company will go bankrupt. In other words, companies in Morocco will go bankrupt and we the unemployed people will be on a holiday to the Day of Judgment. Salam alaikum. I will humbly introduce myself to you. I am a professional driver of heavy trucks with trailers. But I am unemployed. I hope I won't be disappointed as usual in my job hunt. May God assist you, us and those in charge of employment of competent workers. Salam.
Salam alikum. I have a diploma of mechanic this year. I ask your honour for a job in any field or a way to enter the job market. May God reward you with good.
Abdellah Elhaoiri, 46. I am looking for a job, monitor of tile fixing works, marble, chimney, mosaic, red tiles, refractory tiles. I have a long experience and high expertise. If anyone is interested, please call me. I live in Tikiouine Agadir. I was born in Ouarzazate. Peace, mercy and blessings of God be upon you. I hope to work with the sons of my country, develop it, God willing. Praise be to God, I have experience. I just need someone to understand me. Salam.
In reality I have never thought before of attending vocational training. But it is my conditions which have pushed me to it, as I haven't passed in the baccalaureate. I didn't come back to complete my studies. I found vocational training as the only solution. However, there is the problem of language. I can't describe you the teacher. Honestly, vocational training is a very good idea. There are girls with me who have high degrees. Honestly it is a good idea if only for that…
I would like to ask whether I can have information about professional training. Thank you.
The bac is very difficult this year.
This site is very nice.
Very nice. Honestly, I would like to work.
Hi I am Mehdi. I love Fnaire to death.
Hi Fnaire. A nice rap band. Long live Fnaire forever.
God bless Fnaire, that is all.
Honestly you are the best for me, I like so much your songs. You must come to Nador to offer us a concert, is that ok? I also want to tell you but in the dialect of Marrakech, I die for you. I am crazy for Marrakech, it is the beauty queen of Morocco, I was born there. Good luck to you. Thank you.
All Moroccans are with you. Bravo.
Hi I am Sara from Temara, I love you Fnaire so much. The best band and wish you success.
I love this artist so much!
There is no life in those you call! O Lord make our hearts persevere in your path and have mercy on our dead people!
Shame on you Star Academy, may God guide you.
Salam. I am Nader. I want to play with a club please. I want to play with CODEM but there are problems. Please any club, ok. Peace, mercy and blessings of God be upon you.
I love you Haifa. For me, you're the best. You are the best for me.
Congratulations to the Libyan people for the death of Moamer Kadhafi!
From God we are and to God we shall return.
I hope from God we will win over Algeria. We will win God willing! However, the coach must be ready because we will face a very strong rival. We wish victory to Atlas lions and to all Moroccans inside and outside Morocco. Thank you!
The messenger of God, peace and blessings of God be upon him, said that honouring a dead person was by burying him. Moreover, the killer of Kadhafi isn't Muslim and doesn't know Islam. No matter what he did, he shouldn't be killed in this abusive way. No matter what happened, Moamer Kadhafi did a lot of things for Libya. Just expect now what is awaiting you o people of Libya! You will see that your country will become like Iraq and time will show this. God suffices me and He is the best mandate!
I am very happy with the liberation of Libya but very sad because it is not right that they do this to him. They should have submitted him to justice.
Haifa isn't nice, but is just plastic surgeries which made her like this. She is exaggerating too much in the film "Chahata". She is a very dirty singer. Is this Islam in your opinion? She is a rubbish in society and other artists like her. Who is the father of the daughter she left?
God is my mandate and He is the best mandate
I am happy with the Eid by God the Almighty. But since I don't have resources, I didn't celebrate the Eid. I committed suicide. Now I am dead.
He is the king, why should you interfere with him? Isn't he the father of the country?
I am a Moroccan man who lives in Valencia. I am the father of three children. I have experience in pollution of the environment. Through my experience and research, I can say that I can reach a temperature of 1200 centigrade in a simple way. I call it a new energy which is combustible without polluting the environment and trees.
Please, I need help in setting up a poultry project.
No one will benefit, all this is robbery.
Does the association have a branch in any Moroccan cities? Which ones? I would like to visit your centre. I have a project and need your support. What are your conditions in this regard? Do you help businesses with different specialties or only traditional handicraft?
Salam alikum. My name is Ahmed from Zagora. May God reward you with good. I have one problem. I have a project in Casa. However, I don't have resources to expand the project. The income is not enough. I have a responsibility and I pay rent. This is very difficult for me. I am going backward. May God bless you, I am not asking for something free. I want a loan, may God rest the souls of your parents in peace.
Salam. I would like to set up a company. Is there any help from the state?
Salam. I would like to set up a project.
I would like to know the fate of five players who were chosen in the football championship of Amal Oujda. I am one of those five players.
Salam. My name is Ayoub. I live in Casa. I want to join the academy, may God reward you with good, give me the phone of the management of the academy.
Hi, this a good paper. We want it to say the truth ok about the national team. It is deteriorating.
God suffices me and He is the best mandate! God, Moamer and Libya alone!
Congratulations!
Hi Bassma. I love you so much especially when you entertain me with your voice. I hope to meet you. I will come to Ouarzazate just for you. even if you haven't won, it is you who deserves the title by God. I voted for you many times but it is fate. Be sure that you have caused a tumult in Morocco. I am a daughter of Casablanca. I am originally from Ouarzazate. Now I live in Agadir. This is my phone number, I hope to meet you. Thank you; go ahead in your artistic career. My mud dies for you.
We love you Bassma.
Salam. The exam was easy. I hope that there will be no cheating.
I want to know please where to find the corrections of the 2008 bac.
Salam. I am happy with this achievement.
Bassma, you're a star, my life hahaha.
I wish success to everyone this year. In my opinion, everything is easy and everything is difficult. But with determination and will everything is possible.
Neither Kaki nor anyone else! Enough scandals! We hope that the Atlas Lionesses will be better!
I hope Zaki will be hired again. Zaki forever! Chamakh is a good player!
Question: Will there be, in the future, a football squad we can be proud of? Thank you!
There's no one like Bado Zaki! If only he'd come back. If not him, we should have Hassan Chahata.
Badou Zaki, for training Morocco.
I love Atlas Lions. I love Omar Najdi. I hope I will have the necessary competence to become like him. I want him to join the Moroccan team.
I want Bado Zaki 100, 1000 times, OK?
Bado Zaki is everything.
I am 21. I would like to train myself. I would like to join vocational training. I don't know which field to study in order to find a job in future. Please help me!

Hi, hello, how are you, I'm Nabil, I love Soraya, RAJA forever, you're the most beautiful girl in the world, always my love.
The thing I'll tell you is that may God protect your parents and protect you.
I am Lolo. I live in Settat. I am fond of the Moroccan Caftan. I hope you will help me find something for my wedding with my darling, amen. Bye.
This is unacceptable because this is denigrating our tolerant religion. Disbelievers who did this should be fought.
True but fascinating.
The most honourable creatures of God is being denigrated? This is how we Muslims are. We keep silent. Shame in us!
O Lord this is enormous!
I am Bilal. I was excited to build new Morocco. However, I failed.
Hi. I wish well to prisoners, may God release them and grant them patience.
Is it possible to participate with you? You're the best site I have seen in my life.
May God bring what has good in it!
I want Tunisia to be fine.
I am Moroccan. We always suffer from road accidents. There should be an end to this.
Salam. I am Abdou, condolences.
We want Ennahda to go away. We're done with it.
They imitated western woman but only in immorality and they replaced pulp with peels.
I would like to be like you this year. You have honoured Morocco. I thank you from all my heart. Peace of God be upon you.
God willing, Algeria will be bright! We will win 3-0 God willing! 1, 2, 3 viva Algeria! Sif from Costantine.
Salam alikum. We in Lakhssass have no laboratory. This is a shame; what education are you talking about?
I love Club Africain so much.
I am a big fan of Nass Elghiwane and I greet all their other fans!
Long live, Lmachaheb, Essiham, Larsad and Irwan!
I thank you for this information and topics which you have provided to us.
Hi, how are you. I live in Algeria. I love Nancy, I love her so much. I love her to death, she's a great artist, I dream of meeting her one day. Bye.
Oh Nancy, oh moon I love you.
Salam brother, it is mandatory for men
I wish you happy success and 10000000000000000 congratulations! Wishing the same to us!
The topic is nice because it talks about coexistence. I notice that Morocco welcomes all religions. This shows that there is no discrimination. Thank you.
Moroccan til death!
Salam. I would like to set up a business but there is no one to help me. I have 20000 dirhams. Can I do a project?
...I'm very happy, that's it, good good.
It is no longer of any use.
May God protect you for your parents and grant you success in your life!
Salam. I congratulate you my sister Sara for this grade point average. You have honored Morocco. I wish myself and all students success o Lord! I congratulate you.
Well done! Way to go sister! Well done, keep up!
We would like to establish a policy of dialog between nations and Islamic religions, tolerance between nations. We want the policy of Barack to be a policy of dialog not a policy of intrusion like Bush.
Everyone respects you! We wish you success and success as you have honoured our country!
I am a young girl from Morocco. I study in the baccalaureate. Honestly, passing rate in the second session is odd. No one, this beggars belief. Why this? I don't know. I don't know. Honestly, it is odd. I don't know how this happened. I was shocked because I don't deserve this. I worked hard to pass. But unfortunately, I passed but correctors ruined me. By God, I will ,never forgive them!
Salam alikum. This is not acceptable! Why a regional exam? Why do they supervise us? Why? Mustapha. Salam.
Salam alikum. It is nice every student passes the bac in his life because without studies nothing can be achieved. This year, I will sit for the bac in SVT. Pray with me please to pass with the highest honours! I am a girl from Agadir. I wish success to all students.
To the one who wrote about the rate of poverty in Morocco. First of all, the expression Berber is unaccepted and you are the biggest barbarous I have ever seen.
Salam alikum. Remove regional exam because it frustrates us. Thank you!
I hate exams especially regional exam. Even if I study well, I forget everything, by God. I don't know from where they come up with such questions. In the class we study something different but in the exams they give us something we never seen or studied. This is the truth whether you like it or not. When I am taking the exam, I just wish the author of questions will stand in front of me and I will strangle him! Ok, this is my opinion honestly. Thank you!
I will sit for regional exam and wish to pass.
Salam. I see that the drop in the pass rate is due to the lack of training of educational staff. We see that a lower secondary teacher teaches in the secondary which is not his level!!! Moreover, it is also due to lack of interest of students in studies and their preoccupation in other things! Thank you!
Hicham El Guerrouj is great!
I am a Tunisian son of Tunisia.
My name is Ismael from Barcelona. I die for the Moroccan national team. I love my country so much. (so much, so much) Morocco forever, Morocco, Moroccans to death.
I haven't passed yet. My wish is to pass the bac, bring happiness ton my mother and have a nice life. Pray with me may God protect you! I want the bac by all means. I haven't passed but I will do the re-sit exam. I want to be one of the girls who passed. I study arts. I live in Zemmour. Pray for me to pass! I am a good girl and my heart is pure. My family is poor. I live with my family. My father died in 2006.
Please advise me. I have a lump in my neck and don't know the origin of such lumps. Please advise me, thank you.
What are symptoms of breast cancer? Please reply soon.
Peace, mercy and blessings of God be upon you. I have a relative who has cancer, she has leukaemia. She doesn't have necessary resources. Her mother works in houses. Everything she gets from work, she spends it on the treatment of her daughter. This girl I am talking about suffered from cancer, she healed, but it has returned. Now she is in a critical condition. Only God knows if she will recover or not. I want your help dear ones. I hope you will help this poor sick girl who has cancer. I wish recovery to everyone. Thank you for reading my words. Bye.
Salam alikum my Muslim brothers. My uncle has liver cancer. He tried all means to recover but they have stopped administering him medicines. He just uses plants. Now he is in bed. He is 40; he has two children. I hope you will help my uncle with your prayers. If anyone has a solution, inform us as soon as possible, please. I hope to have a reply a soon as possible. Oh Lord, heal my poor uncle and all Muslims.
Salam. My name is Ali. I am looking for an answer. Is it true that cancer has treatment? My sister died of this disease. My brother also has cancer, he is barely 23. This disease is costly. I wish recovery to all Muslims from any disease.
Salam. My name is Naima. I ask you to help me. My mother has a lump. The doctor told you it is in your breast. He told her to do some test. We don't have the resources. God is the most powerful. We can barely cover the daily needs of life. I am tired of looking for a solution for my mother. I can do nothing for her. Sometimes I say to myself, "Why she is alive, if only she were dead rather than seeing her like this while I can do nothing for her." I want a benefactor to help me or guide me to an association. I go to associations here, they don't listen to you. They tell you, "We will help you, just wait until tomorrow." But I don't even know what is the disease of my mother. Please, I no longer know what to tell you.
Salam alikum. I have additional information to all Muslims. Cancer is from Djinn as the messenger of God said. It is from plague as it was said in the Hadith. Therefore, we must read Qur'an and take herb medicines such as Al Habba Assaouda with pure honey and pray God. They will recover God willing.
The best writer in the world!
Peace of God be upon you. Mohamed Choukri, may God rest his soul, to sum up, he was a very strong personality. I conclude with a proverb "Poverty nearly became disbelief". Salam.
I am a young man, 26. I am a member in an association. I need help. The association needs help. Some people need help and I want you to tell me how to benefit from this association.
My mother has breast cancer. I am scared that she dies.
I had 18 in the regional exam and didn't pass the baccalaureate. This is unacceptable.
I am against microcredit because of problems faced by Moroccans because of them.
Algeria, Algeria and Algeria. God willing oh Lord. My heart will stop beating if we lose. 3-1 God willing.
Salafists are garbage disbelievers. By God, they are devils on earth.
I asked the naked what you need, he said I need a ring! "O ye who believe! Fear Allah, and let every soul look to what (provision) He has sent forth for the morrow" Mawazine is a shame for social and moral values. I am not against art or progress, not at all! But given current economic and social problems, our countries cannot allow such a futility. Even if our country dreams of making progress, it only has to imitate the model of Turkey. It is a real developed Muslim country which has achieved its goals with La Ilaha Illa Allah, Mohamed Rasoul Allah (There is no other God but Allah, Mohamed is the messenger of God).
Hi, we hope that drugs will be fought.
Congratulations to Libyans for the death of Kadhafi!
Hi, my favourite artist is Zyat because really his voice is great thanks
Does this mean that passing rate will be higher?
Salam Rachid how are you you're the best actor in Morocco I wish you success
The Sahara is Moroccan and will remain Moroccan. We know that Algerians write in their names that they are Sahrawi. They want to divide Morocco. We won't allow you to do this. We love Sahrawis.
Salam alikum. We must see who has interest in our division. I think that Morocco despite its internal problems, it is acting to solve them. Concerning their king, we cannot judge him in this period in which he is ruling. He can still act. I think it is generals who are causing problems. They have eaten the crops. I think that Bouteflika is also a king like any Arab country. I don't understand if presidency has become like monarchy. At least I see that Morocco, Saudi Arabia and Jordan at least know they have a king. But other countries may be don't see that. Anyway, God's acts prevail. Jews have made for us things in which to make ourselves busy and forget our religion if we still have a religion.
Salam. The basis of the issue is that when we go to loans offices to boost the economy, set up a business or start a trade, we just think of the amount which this side can provide us without a pre-study of how to invest that amount. As for the interest added to this amount, these are just fees to the offices you address where you find people at your service. Thank you!
I'm Sahrawi. I was born in Sahara. My roots are established in Sahara. I say: Sahara is Moroccan, regardless of different opinions. Long live the king!
Sahara is Moroccan. The main hurdle to the Maghreb Union is Western interventions. Spain is considered a bomb to all this.
Salam. How are you? My name is Majda from Morocco. I like Moroccan dress so much. I wish you would offer me one as a present, hahahaha! Thank you, wish you success!
This is not the appropriate timing for this festival because of the exams.
We are a people whose men aren't educated! They are talking about gender cleaning! Are they animals? Why do we women watch them wearing shorts but it is normal, or do we have no feelings? Odd, what a humiliation in the name of religion?
Salam Alaikoum, I also play Badminton in Algeria.
Salam alikum. "Verily never will Allah change the condition of a people until they change it themselves (with their own souls)." "Your rulers are like you". I apologise for writing in non-Arabic alphabet.
As peaceful Moroccans, we love peace and I love Moamer Kadhafi. I hope that we will be come two brotherly countries we are also countries of the Arab Maghreb. I hope that relations will continue as they were with the late Hassan II may God rest his souls. Thank you.
Long live Morocco and the Moroccan Sahara!
It is so nice to see a high quality company making such an offer.
Is it possible to make the internet quicker?
I am very sad for this bloody fate in Libya. I am very sad for the innocents and very sad for the end of Kadhafi.
We die for Morocco. Viva Morocco, viva our king! Morocco forever! May God protect us, amen!
Congratulations Hajar, the star
Hajar I love you so much.
Hi Hajar, congratulations, this is my msn [emailprotected] /* */
The theater is very nice.
I wanted Hajar to be the star and I wasn't disappointed
I love star academy so much and I love Hajar and Yousra, good luck to everyone.
I don't know why workers don't do their jobs to reject 'chocolate' or call it as you wish. Its name is bribery. Can someone reply to this question?
Salam alaikoum. This site is nice. It has everything I want. Thank you very much, particularly for the news on Morocco. It's good.
Thank you!
I'm proud of our past. We should therefore do more research into it.
I am a young man who loves trade, especially at a high level. I am 18 and I think there is a big defect in trade in Derb Omar and it will affect Moroccan traders. This will be seen in the short term. Thank you.
Hi the stars, I love so much Farid, I hope inchallah that he will be a singer.
I tell you that this intricate problem cannot be solved with that proposal submitted by Morocco and we want a new proposal satisfying both parties
God is sufficient for me and He is the best disposer of affairs.
I curse them a lot because I love the messenger of God more than anything.
Leave them to God, He can take our right from them.
Their fate is known. There is no power and no will but from God Lord of the worlds.
Salam, I like Hajar Fatin Kawtar I wish them success
I encourage Jamal a lot, he has a strong voice, and I tell him go ahead you'll be inchallah the star with success
There is no other God but God.
I am Abdssamad. I like Nass El Ghiwane. I offer my greetings to Omar Sayed and Batma. My wish is to be a singer with them. They are always in my mind. Bye. I thank Nass El Ghiwane. Ok.
Hi. I am Zhour and I hope one day to see Nass El Ghiwane because I love them so much. I listen to them a lot and hope to come to Morocco and meet them. I hope just one day to meet our beloved brother Arbi. All of them are our brothers. It's the best band in the world. May God grant them a long life. It is impossible for me to forget them, it is impossible. I love you Al Ghiwane…Zhour.
I want to know the balance of my account.
I am adherent in CNSS. I want one thing. I would like to know the number of my points I have but I don't know how. So please help me!
Hi Bigg. Look I want to tell you something, even if you fly, there's nothing you can do. Singing is forbidden in Islam. It's hell waiting for you, inchallah. May God guide you to the right path. There's no power and no will but from God.
Bassma, your voice is fascinating. You're all beautiful. Personally, you fascinate me with everything you have.
Good evening! Is it possible to know the number of days I have?
Peace of God be upon you. I would like to know the salary declared by the company to CNSS.
My name is Ayyoub. I am 17. I want to register with you in vocational training. I hope you will select me. I love electricity. I hope God will grant me success in training.
I am Ilham from the city of Agadir. I am inquiring about available courses in the vocational training for students in the elementary and entry conditions.
I want to register.
I am Zineb from Morocco. I am 21. I study in the 9th grade. I am looking for an adequate training. I hope you will help me.
I study in the institute. I study in the fourth year of the baccalaureate. Is there any future, possible hopes?
I study in vocational training in Agadir. I specialize in pastry baking. I want to get a job in my field of expertise.
Salam alikum. My name is Issam. I am 19. I am looking for some training but I don't have an adequate educational background. I have reached the eight grade of the elementary. Can I join some good training? I want you to help me. May God bless you.
I study in the baccalaureate. I want to know prospects for studies if I don't succeed in studies. Thank you.
I am Omar from Kénitra. I have registered in vocational training in aluminum. Do they grant a diploma or certificate? Please reply. Thank you because I will begin studies on 1/11.
Hi, this is a good project.
Has Sanaa Akroud died or is it just a rumour?
I, too, have a big problem with French. We want you to find us a solution for this phenomenon, because 90% of students are disadvantaged because of French. Please help us, because many students don't have money or any resources. Do good and you will sow good! Thank you very much! Bye!
Salam. Honestly, we also contribute to the problem because we don't read a lot. One goes abroad for 2 or one year, but we study it for at least 10 years and can't read it. Therefore, everyone of us must read even for one hour a day. If he doesn't know a word, he must check it in the dictionary, explain the word he cannot understand. In that way we would have achieved about 50% of reading. Then we can speak it.
My brother, this is the Mufti of our country. May God grant him long life. The most important is that I don't ask someone who has nothing to do with Tunisia and who insults my country day and night. If you aren't happy, take out your head. It is ok. Oh Lord preserve for us Tunisia the secularist which refuses to follow Al Saoud, the worst people of Lout. Long live Tunisia. Long live beauty. Let those who are not happy die with jealousy.
Greetings Bouira!
The grand Maghreb is replete with an art culture!
Long live Moroccan Sahara forever! Nada from Morocco.
I'm proud of our Morocco and our soldiers. I want to become a soldier. Is there any exam for soldiers?
Salam alikum. All I want to say is that we have to rid ourselves of everything that isn't clear. Since we consider ourselves Muslims, we have to base our acts on what satisfies God the Almighty. To tell the truth, we must follow the righteous followers - I mean the followers of the tradition of the Messenger and the Jamaa, not the Takfirists. May God guide us and you. I ask God to unite our hearts for what God the Almighty likes and accepts.
Is it possible to participate in Star Academy Maghreb? Please! I am from Morocco.
In fact I'm very sorry and sad for what's happening to us in our country the Arab Maghreb. Why all this hatred and against whom? Against your Muslim brothers this isn't our culture it's an extraneous culture I'm very sorry for our young people who had their brains washed and the criminals filled them with ideas of accusing people of infidelity to kill whom? I and all Moroccans and all the Arab Maghreb in general we won't allow any person to destroy us or dissipate our resources or destroy our future and we'll fight them fiercely the proof is the thwarted attempts which were in vain, they were thwarted by the security first and with the help of citizens jealous over their country thanks to God for their presence. Here I address a call to all associations and all institutes to raise awareness of the young people and help them so that they don't fall in the trap of frustration and thus become victims of the groups accusing people of infidelity and May God save us from their evils.
Be careful my brothers I'm really concerned about you
I'm a Moroccan girl, I have experienced these celebrations but your article still explained many things I didn't know before.
Congratulations Azouz though Basma and Micho deserve it more, by God, by God. God is the greatest, go on in your way.
Salam alikum. Long live Algeria and Bahara beach.
Salam, Algeria, Douar Bahara.
Long live Algeria and people of Bahara beach.
I am Inase from Khenchela. I love the province of Bejaia. Some of the best beaches I visited are Tishi, Boulimat and Zigwat. I want to say one thing, if you want to swim, go to Bejaia. Thank you.
Long live Bahara beach and illegal immigrants Adil Chmite and Nacer Tonipa.
God's curse on you ignoramuses!
Honestly I was really sorry for Bassma. She was the best in the programme. I really don't know what happened with her.
Mhamed, Qwaider, Saad  Nader all deserve to be star 2008. Even if they have reached the final, it is only one who should take the star title. Many congratulations Nader, you deserve it.
I love so much judo. I have a brown belt.
Saksoka passed through Bouabid and went there.
I want a festival in Khouribga in French.
I love you a tonne, Fella.
I'm a teacher in the region of Lhajab. What do you want to know about the history of this town?
I hope to pass. I wish success to everyone. However, exams are very difficult. Anyway, may God grant success to everyone! Moreover, supervision is very tight, to the point that the candidate is nervous about the supervision, even if he has no way to cheat. But he can't concentrate on the exam. Anyway, I hope the Ministry of Education will make the exam easy this year and increase passing rates and that passing grade averages will be higher, because students face many difficulties in graduate studies if they don't have money to cover their studies. Some of them even have to drop their studies. Salam. With my respects to everyone.
Hello, how are you, poor Morocco it is going downhill
Honestly, Bilal you are always great, the king of rai because you have a great style. You and Cheb Nasro prince of the sentimental song, take care of yourselves because you lift the flag of the Algerian artist and Nasro in Chicago. Really you 2 are the stars of rai.
All girls must wear decent and respectable clothes because if you don't firstly respect yourself, no one will respect you and thus he deserves everything that happens to him. So wear your clothes. I am also a girl but I know what to wear and what I shouldn't wear.
Peace, mercy and blessings of God be upon you. Firstly, we are a Muslim country. Our grandfathers and our parents didn't educate us in tyranny which we see these days. No one wants anymore the word of truth. How can you deal with them? I personally live in Casa, sometimes you can't control yourself especially with the girl or woman who is the wife of a man, a daughter or mother. Now they all wear tight and short clothes. But we men get excited with them like this girl, she deserves burning along with all those who show their charms. Or I forgot, maybe the name of their father is Jakk or Bernard! But this woman is Moroccan. They are growing only from the back like those sheep at 2000 dirhams! Then they come up and say freedom of expression! The prophet, peace and blessings of God be upon him, said "if you have no shame, do whatever you want!" Tomorrow, there will be judgment before God!
I love Morocco so much
I love Bilal to death, because he talks about the reality in which I live in particular especially my song "oh oh oh, what awful days".
They did well to her! Are we westerners or what? In this way they would respect themselves a little. We are Muslims and this shouldn't be done by our women. Therefore, every young man who has a sister or a man who has a daughter should make her wear decent clothes. Have some shame girls! Personal freedom does not mean nakedness in front of people!!
We love the messenger of God, no matter what they say or do. God is sufficient for us and He is the best disposer of affairs.
Bilal, Bilal forever. The friend Bilal. Singing of men. May God protect you.
Thank you very much for all this information! By God, we learn a lot from them!
I am a big fan of FAR Rabat because it is the best team and is greatly indebted to the late Hicahm. I wish all the success to this club. I am from Sidi Rahhal!
Honestly, they may not find a solution to piracy, it's impossible.
Salam alikum. I would like to find a site for fatwa please. It is urgent. May God bless you!
Bless you! What is all this vice we have in Morocco? The greatest religion is Islam. Why don't we live with Islamic Sharia? What individual freedom are you talking about? Are you walking alone on the streets so that you wear what you want? Religion hasn't told us to wear what we want in front of everyone no, individual freedom is with yourself. O Lord this is enormous, it is not just about hijab, there is too much, may God guide us and guide all Muslims, o Lord!
Anyone who wears a beard says I am a Muslim! Most of them are corrupt and don't know religion. Their clothes are dirty, their beards smell bad because of dirt and still they say we are Muslims! Islam is cleanliness.
FAR/RIAL forever.
Salam alikum. Look, those who don't have ideas in their minds, are poor like me. Can't you help me to save myself? I am 29, there is nothing
We thank you for this initiative.
Honestly, I attended Zamo's show yesterday in hay Riad. It was great but the people are sick because Hay Nahda doesn't have great people.
For me, Mawazine is a waste of money and of Moroccans and time. Why don't we like Moroccan artists? Thank you. This is my opinion. I hope that you will appreciate it.
Honestly, if Morocco doesn't know where to take its money, it can at least help the needy. We are fighting corruption and they bring us the corruption to us like that Nancy. She shouldn't even enter, she has insulted God so she is a disbeliever. Thank you.
Sister Houda, God bless you. May God make many people like you. Anyway sister Houda, if you find a job and want us to co-operate in life, I am ready. I know you might become an engineer or a nice job. May God bring you all the good.
I thank very much this initiative of this entreprise and hope they will achieve great success because the young people of the Maghreb are going astray.
I am mad about your voice.
Thanks to everyone who contributed to the success of this site directly or indirectly!
I would like to work in a company as secretary.
Salam. We ask officials to provide job openings for Moroccan young people. We don't want to have any more doubts that we are Moroccans while foreigners have more rights than us. May God bring someone to understand us!
I am a 32 year-old Moroccan young man. I have B, C, E categories driving licenses. I have experience as a driver in the category B. I am looking for a job. May God reward you with all the good! By the way, our government has forgotten us as if we are superfluous in this country. We are getting old and we haven't found a job. Don't we have the right to live as well and have children? Aren't we all humans? May God protect us, that's all! This is not acceptable. Everyone is getting selfish. Anyway, we will be patient even if we have gone beyond the limits of patience!
I am looking for courses. I am a first year university student.
I am looking for a job in any field.
This year, despite difficulty in exams, the passing rate was higher.
I hail from Zagora. My teachers are very good. We thank them for this. Thank you!
The exam 2011 was easy. However, Mohamed Siraj high school was distinguished by the pass rate it has achieved.
I would like to know results of the baccalaureate 2011. We are tired of waiting. They don't want to reply to us. I hope they will reply to us as soon as possible. Salam alikum.
Hi, how are you? Thank you for this site! I hope you will help me find a job. May God reward you with all good things!
Always BARCA
Praise be to God. This year, exams were accessible because students haven't studied anything this year given strikes and problems. Therefore, they have taken into consideration these conditions and exams were accessible. Wish you all success, God willing!
May God take revenge on those who were the cause for the absence of our flag from Angola. Now we support enemies instead of our country.
Magharebia is always in my heart
Moroccans till death
I personally don't acknowledge this Fnaire. What's this traditional commercial rap? You're looking for money, you don't want to transmit a message and those who listen to your songs mostly have nothing to do with rap, they just listen to it. By God, it's a shame on you, you have lowered the status of rap. Lalla Manana, no Lalla Khadouj is better. Sing underground or Ayad has gone up.
AIDs is a serious disease. I despise everyone who has the disease, because the sick have committed an enormous deed punishable by God. I am ready for a debate with the media or anyone. Therefore, I provoke everyone who has the disease by saying if you had protected yourself from enormities, you wouldn't have gotten the disease. Salam, bye!
I hope this disease will disappear from the country. There are over 25% affected with this disease. I hope Morocco will get better.
O Lord this is your land and we are your creatures, You are capable of guiding your creatures, o Lord protect us from those who don't fear Your punishment. You know better our weakness, amen!
I want to say that Belkhadem is a good man because he is generous, he is a clear example of a professional official.
Long live Algeria.
She is the symbol of pride.
May God rest the soul of Kadhafi, his sons and all Libyans who died for their country (they are real martyrs). May God rest the soul of Kadhafi and all Mujahids in peace!
Congratulations Mr Abdelilah Benkiran! "And say: Work: Soon will Allah observe your work, and His Messenger".
God is the greatest! May God rest your soul in peace o leader!
Salam Hajar you've made the young and old love you
We will solicit His Majesty the King Mohammed VI to consider this request to close all the indecent cafes which don't honour Morocco as an Islamic country. Hichame.
Welcome to the capital. You are welcome. It is my dear city.
Latifa the Tunisian
May God grant victory to our brothers in Libya against the criminal Kadhafi and those with him!
I am Mouhamed Bougrine from Akka, Morocco. I love you Diaa.
May God grant victory to rebels! Victory is very close, God willing!
I am a Moroccan young girl. I want to participate in singing like the singer Nabila and others. I hope that you will reply to me on this number. Please reply to me. Now tell me what to do, ok.
By God, it is Diaa who deserves to be the star. Even Saad doesn't deserve it because she is frank and needs a sincere man not a liar.
You are talking only about Si Benkirane. Why didn't you speak out a long time ago while this government was fighting us? The man has not even been for one year in power and you hold him accountable! Let him act his way and trust him! You should never be afraid of someone who fears God. I trust him. In the coming elections, I will vote for him along with all the people, my city and all my family. We support you Mr Benkirane. Men support men and men are supported by God. God grants success.
Mr Benkirane, what you are doing is a shame. By God, it is a shame! Young people are lost. Some have become angry and turned to robbery. Some became angry and killed because of this system of the government. I am moving in this way. I want to do a legitimate business but law enforcement officers didn't let me. So do we have to die, rob or kill? Try to talk to them about this humiliation inflicted on us by auxiliary forces. If we count the number of street vendors, we will find that their number is bigger than formal merchants.
Yesterday you have been hailing Kadhafi and today you are ill-treating his corpse. Are you Muslims? If you were so, where is honouring the dead?
We are with the Libyan people.
Be realistic!
Fear God Who created you! Peace, mercy and blessings of God be upon you.
I am an employee at the university. My monthly income is low. I want to benefit from this project of suitable housing in the city of Safi. Please consider my request. Thank you!
I ask you to pray with me God to grant me success in my studies. May God reward you with good! Salam.
You are beautiful; God bless you! Good luck!
Thank you for this site. Salam alikoum.
We are for Jihad and we are opponents of the USA to the last day of our life.
Salam. I am Rachid Essabari from Had Eswalem. I was victim of an attack, along with my family. I informed authorities about that but they didn't do anything…
Congratulations to the Libyan people, wishing the same to Syria and Yemen!
Viva Libya, viva Tunisia, viva the right!
Hi! I found this project is very exhaustive and useful for a lot of reasons. First of all, Morocco has many social and economic problems. Therefore, it is normal that there are many psychological problems. This project might help in recruiting many graduates at least part of them.
Very nice!
I would like to know the place because I am suffering and sad.
Bassma forever.
I am a psychologist. I am 33 years old. All these ideas you have said are correct.
The Day of Judgement is close by. They will be tortured for everything.
I am Houda from the city of Meknes. I am 19. I dropped out school in the year of the baccalaureate last year. I would like to enroll in a vocational training centre. Therefore, I ask you to give me some information and whether there is still an opportunity to register. Thank you very much!
This year, I will sit for the baccalaureate exam in physical sciences. I am only good in PC. I don't feel comfortable about studies. If there are any horizons in vocational training, please help me!
I like it.
Salam (Peace)
I am Ali. Hi! I would like to join vocational training. I am 17. I have studied up to the fourth year of the lower secondary.
Salam. I am 17. I would like to register in vocational training. However, they refused because I still study. They said that I should first complete school. But why?
My name is Karim from the city of Rich. My question is that there is no institution for vocational training in the city. We are tired of false promises.
Hi. We hope that you will expand the site more.
My name is Hajar from Morocco. I am 17. At the beginning, I didn't like school. But now, school is everything. I used to fail. However, God the Almighty doesn't disappoint any of His servants!
Salam alikum. I need your help. My brother is 17 and he is now addicted to tobacco. I would like to help him. Please tell me if there are associations which help smokers. Are there medicines which can help him get rid of nicotine? May God reward you with all the good!
May God make things easy for us!
Hi everyone I love you Hajar so much hope you'll be the star
Salam. I am Iman, 26. I married 6 months ago. My husband is Moroccan. I am pregnant and he wants to divorce because of his mother. She doesn't like me. Please, what is the procedure to follow?
I'm Ferdaouse from Marrakech I wish a good luck to all, I like Hajar, Badro, Khayri and of course the tanjawi the son of our country Hamid hhhh. I want you to sing for me with your guitar a nice song and bye
My brother is mentally disabled. I am looking for a school for him in Agadir or in some other city but it should be a boarding school. He is now 17. I hope to find a reply.
Kaoutar you're the best one, Hajar and Fatin everyone
It is God Who has created the human being and He knows what this human being will do in his life. He also knows what will be his punishment. Therefore, o Tunisian men and Tunisian women, you have to stand in the face of this assault. The Day of Judgement is very close by. So, the most important thing is that we don't lose our faith in God the Almighty Who has created everything in the universe and He is the most powerful and most generous. Say Allah Akbar (God is the greatest)! Say Allah Akbar! Say Allah Akbar! God is the greatest! God is the greatest! God is the greatest!
There is no other God but Allah, Mohamed is the messenger of God.
This film denigrating the prophet, peace and blessings of God be upon him, has offended all Muslims. Therefore, we have to stand up in order to defend Islam of God. This is because the prophet of God went into hardships in order to spread the faith of Islam. We have to stop anyone who wants to denigrate the messenger. It is God Who chose him to spread His law and faith. He was good-mannered, patient when he was beaten and injured by disbelievers. There is no power and no will but from God.
Why do they immigrate?
I like the participation.
If they really know God, they would not have assaulted her. They would have advised her.
Everyone is free to do what they want.
Salam. Thank you almallam boujemaa for the article. It is an interesting article. But we hope that someone else writes a more explicit article. This means that we want to know the rate of shanty towns in Morocco and the problems endured by these people living in shanty towns. As you have said before, there are people who have a house but come to swarm with poor people. This is the consequence of illiteracy and backwardness because everyone thinks of himself in Morocco. This is why we have many poor people.
Salam alikum. I am a married woman. My husband lives in Saudi Arabia. He has a low income. I would like to know conditions and requirements to buy an apartment with a loan over many years. How much should I pay as discount?
What you do is not bad but we want you tackle topics more deeply. Good luck.
Have some shame, you're in an Islamic state!
Too many protests, too many letters, too many debates and still they can't find a solution to shantytowns or the so-called "karyanat"! This is not because they lack resources because only God knows where budgets have gone! A man can do no more than he can!
An interesting topic. However it is not comprehensive. It didn't tackle everything. Anyway, it is a good and rare initiative. Thank you for your move!
No one is making charity to residents in shanty towns. This is their right and nothing free because they burden them with bank loans. So they will remain drowned in loans and on the other hand it would be said that they benefit from the state. This is not true. The only advantage is that they help them emerge in loans. There are shanty towns in Ain Diab, the most prestigious neighbourhood in Casablanca. No one cares about them, they are sought only in the period of elections.
Salam alikum. I come from Mzabe. I like everything. However, there are things tight but praise be to God. I think that Mzabe needs a little strictness. Salam.
Hi, how are you? This is Lamia from Morocco. I like her so much and wish her success. Ok, bye.
Salam. I married and bought a house but not social housing. I bought a house worth 400000 dirhams. I took a loan from the bank. The bank told me I have to pay 3000 dirhams a month. I found out I couldn't pay this sum every month. Now I want to desist. Is this possible given that I received the contract and the check went to the notary? Please reply what I can do!
Morocco is the best country! May God protect it from evil!
You're sweet.
nancy ajrem is the best star in the world she is too pretty and attractive no one hate it
Honestly, Bassma is a star in our eyes. However we had to vote intensively not let the Saudi take it especially because he doesn't like her. Anyway, we Moroccans should poke their eyes. Next time we will vote intensively for a Moroccan.
Honestly, we Moroccans have a great heritage. We should be proud of and show more our culture and namely the Gnawi art and we're all Gnawa.
There is no power and no will but from God. Oh Lord this is enormous. This is what drove us to the bottom. Our society is still prisoner of myths. If it wants its freedom, it should be reborn.
This is just foolishness and useless.
Salam. There is no power and no will but from God. The salvation of Muslims is the Quran and nothing else but the Quran. Sorcery exists, but it doesn't affect anyone but by the will of God. Our recovery is to hold on to our moral values and prayer. The first and foremost reason is ignorance. The Moroccan people are careless. I am not speaking in general; rather, I am addressing our enemies in religion. Muslim people don't trust witchcraft; they would not leave their dear Lord and go to humans like him to achieve their dreams. I am 20. I am still astonished at this nation. But the last thing is to pray for the guidance to our people. I think that if we remain in this condition, our society will remain marginalised, especially when we see there is a category of people who are idols for us in society, who have a number 1 rank in ignorance. So what about others? Moreover, if they really realize the wishes of people, let them realize their own problems. It is God who grants subsistence and a living. I hope there will be something good in the future. Moreover, even young men now believe in such myths. This is a serious problem. We must resolve it as soon as possible. Otherwise, we will remain underdeveloped. You must first solve other problems. These seem idle things. They have more negative aspects. The state must try to solve these issues and fight this phenomenon.
There is no power and no will but from God. May God guide everyone. People are wasting time and money for the anger of God. Anyway, I am mother to a girl of six. I feel emptiness in my life. I wish to have an idea how to take courses in fashion design or making refined pastry to fill my time and help myself materially. I am waiting for the reply. Ok, thank you very much.
This is a shame in Morocco and unacceptable in an Islamic state.
What you say is good, hhhhh.
In my opinion there are still women who don't have their rights.
Salam alikum I have a woman relative who has a problem. She married three months ago. He took her alone to a house where there is no WC and shower. He ties her, rapes her, beats her, he ties her hands and feet. He tortures her and treats her like an animal. When her mother went to see her, she found her tied with a wire and made a plan to take her out. Now he is suing her in court with her mother. Do you think that justice will be granted to her?
I'm Mohamed from Mrirt I wish to Hicham El Guerrouj to come back to his distances because he's still strong and there's no one in 1500 in the Olympics. I hope that he will come back because we want him to play even if 3 years 25
I love El Guerrouj and hope to be like El Guerrouj and become a champion- I'm in a very nice region Azilall.
I love you so much and wish to marry you. I am the director of the school of engineers in Mohammadia.
Salam Rabie. I tell you honestly that I wasn't one of your fans. But after "Al Farah Sagher" (the small ceremony), there is someone in my mind called Rabie. "Al Bod Al Akhar" (the other dimension) with Najat Lwafi brought you even closer to me. You were great in that role. I watched afterwards I watched the film "Tadkira Rakm 13" (Ticket no 13). Although you didn't have a big role, I liked the character of inspector Tabt who gives orders, reasonable. Moreover, even your look was great. You looked really distinguished and handsome. Therefore, you might have become one of the actors I respect and the my second favourite actor after my star and greatest actor Sharukhan. Ok, I am not here to tell you I love you because I don't actually love you. I am your fans and respect you. Don't be angry, but I like the truth. I want to tell you good luck and successful career God willing.
This is my message to people who went to mountains and think that they are doing good actions. I am telling them why don't you start with reforming yourselves then move to reforming society and spreading the correct religion of Islam following the path of messenger of God with gentleness as God wishes? Then you can implement the Sharia by imposing sanctions on those who deserve that. I am talking in particular about those who want to spread obscenity amongst believers. What have you changed in society since you went to mountains? All enormities are on the rise!
Salam everyone. Rabie is a great and professional artist. He has all conditions to become a star. I personally die for him especially the looks of his eyes, they're all power and intelligence. He has an unusual attractiveness. He is full of manhood and charisma. I wish him success from my heart, oh Lord. May God protect you and grant you more success.
I, lrazi lmlih, want to be like Hicham Al Garouj in the future 2.
I'm Abdelwahab from Essaouita. I wish to our champion Hicham a happy life after a victorious track. We Moroccan young people always have our hope, will, love for sport and love for the nation. We all hope to see the best substitutes for the best ascendants… The talented who is haunted by athletics, Abdelwahab.
God suffices us and he is the best mandate against Arab rulers.
I failed in the baccalaureate but I hope this year I will be successful with a distinction. I have failed because last year I wasn't serious and didn't want to study. Honestly, those who work hard pass. But those who waste time in gossip won't do anything in their lives.
Salam alikum my brothers. I am a student who has repeated the year. But in spite of repeating the year, I feel as if it is the first time I'm sitting for the baccalaureate. Now I'm very scared. Please help me, please, please. Thank you everyone. Your brother Taki from Morocco, Maths. I wish success to everyone in spite of difficulties we face in this dear nation. Thank you for your replies.
Bac, bac, oof! This bac is like... I don't know what you'd do with it. It's nothing. One should study for it normally, because it's just a matter of luck. Work is the key to success. We must remove the bac as a hard word or something like this. It's just something ordinary. It is just Moroccans who are making so much of it, the press, the papers. The problem is that we do nothing with it. Good luck everyone. May God grant success to everyone.
Salam alikum. I am sick of fanatics about the educational system and cheating in education. This is difficult for the Moroccan ranking among underdeveloped countries. I am very ashamed when I say this. May God find us a good solution!
The state doesn't want the people to progress. It wants them to remain stupid.
God bless our officials! They are treating us like lab mice!
I will sit for the baccalaureate this year. I am very scared. Can you give me an advice? I am very depressed because I have 6 in the regional exam and this term I have 14.61. Have I compensated it or not? Please reply, may God protect you!
Thank you for standing by the Amazigh culture from this perspective.
These people you are talking about, by what right do you address them as salafists? Salafism is a noble name and it has criteria and conditions so as to be a salafist man or a salafist woman. Whenever a rogue attacks a girl - I apologise for using this word - we say he is a salafist, no way. When someone blows up himself or commits suicide, we say salafist. When someone kills, we say salafist, no way. Salafism is more sublime than this. If we were within the context of the state, government of an Islamist party as you say, we would have been fine. As for freedom, my freedom stops when the freedom of the other begins. How can this girl go out almost naked to the street full of rebellious young people and tell her this your freedom, go out as you like? This is not reasonable. She can do whatever she wants at home, but outside she should be respectful, we are Muslims by the way. We will never move forward if our women are like this.
Join you.
I liked this article so much and want to give you a very big kiss.
Hi. I am a Sahraoui man of Sahraoui origins. I am proud of my Sahraoui origins. I praise God because I am not Moroccan with my respects to a minority of the Moroccan people. This is caused by the authorities who are responsible for everything happening in the Sahara. We the Sahraoui people have our opinion and hold on to it. Isn't Morocco the state of freedom and stability? By God, which freedom are you talking about? Now you are saying that Algeria is the cause of postponement of all decisions. This is because it supports the Sahraoui cause. If we stay away from politics and gossip, aren't we Arabs? Even better than this, we are Muslims and we were privileged by God over all religions. Stop, stop all this. Let's be united. We are the best nation raised for humanity. Let's forget these fake conflicts. The land doesn't belong to anyone. We will all die. God alone will remain, He doesn't die. A young man who is jealous for this religion and the Arab world in general. Please forgive me for this expressions which is not adequate. God is the assistant.
You should experience being away from the family (kids) like us. We wouldn't have felt any problem if there was fairness in transfers. But you know that there are people who don't know deserts and isolated areas.
Congratulations to the Libyan people!
Thank you Mohamed and Moussa! Thank you very much!
The death of Kadhafi was a mistake. He was a leader. Who has mourned for Saddam? Who could speak out in the name of Arabs in the USA except him?
Thank you very much.
Salam alikum. My question is whether there is any new changes this year 2008 in the Family Law. I agree with all the laws introduced in the new Family Law. Thank you. I am waiting for the reply.
Salam I wanted to tell you God bless you, I love the roles you play, by God you're a great artist. May God assist you and help you. Bye.
What is new in the family law?
You're my life, my dream is to meet you, I'm very fond of you. You know, I can't live without your films. Kisses
It's God who will give everyone his right, may God take revenge on you Moroccans.
The Sahara is Moroccan, and will remain Moroccan, (unclear) who created the front the problem about it is that it's lying to itself, the Sahara isn't to there and to here, it will never have it may God grant victory to our king Mohamed VI, God assist him and grant him success.
The Sahara is Western Sahara. It's not in our interest for it to be given to Morocco or Algeria; it is the same. They are all thieves, and the people are the victim.
These Salafis are repressed and should go and take care of their own problems. They should leave girls in peace. They are just trying to cover their defects or failures in this life. The evil acts they commit aren't committed by anyone else. If you were real men, show this weakness in something else, not in observing women, ok!
It is a shame that the young girls are stripped of their clothes. They – i.e. girls – should be offered advice in a gentle way. To Salafis, we aren't in the era of Quraish to implement whipping and hatred. Change your mentality! May God guide everyone! Khadija from Taza.
I thank Maroc Telecom for its services, I also thank every official in the company. Blessed Ramadan. To say the truth it's very nice it provides us with good offers, many thanks.
How are your telecoms in the month of Ramadan? It's a shame to steal- wait until Ramadan is over, then steal.
I witness there is no other God but Allah and I witness that our master, our prophet, the purest of all creatures our master Mohamed is the messenger of God and last messenger. We are proud to be an Islamic Umma. We cherish our religion Islam. God's curse on every disbeliever and those who denigrate our prophet beloved by God. Fatima Zahra, Agadir.
Libya today is free. If it doesn't tackle in a good way its new situation, there is a Kadhafi on the way. Be careful!
"Indeed, Allah confers blessing upon the Prophet, and His angels [ask Him to do so]. O you who have believed, ask [Allah to confer] blessing upon him and ask [Allah to grant him] peace." "O you who have believed, if you support Allah, He will support you and plant firmly your feet." God is sufficient for us and He is the best disposer of affairs.
Viva Kadhafi and viva Algeria!
It is over, the man is dead, forget him. Yes, he did many bad things in his life but don't be like him. Libya should move ahead.
Thank you for this information! This is good.
I haven't watched this film yet.
I hope all Arabs will live in peace and freedom. God willing, all the Arab Umma will live in peace.
Here is the result of "Mawazine 2009". Oh Lord this is enormous.
Hi Nasro. I love you so much. Long live Nasro. Fatiha from Morocco.
Why do we find in Morocco most schools rely mainly on scores? This is because there are many students who are smart but aren't lucky in some exams. So for how long will this discrimination persist? Some pupils get scores they don't deserve. I think that entry exams are enough without requiring a fixed score to access some schools.
Salam alikum. I am Shaan from Rabat and London. I love you Morocco!
I am Kokobari. I want to work o people! In Morocco, all of us young people are lost.
Casa forever!
Thank you for this interesting topic. I would like to know wholesalers of cosmetic products so that I can make transactions with them. I have a shop in Laayoune. Thanks to all participants!
I am a Moroccan boy. I am a fan of the long jump. This site is cool.
This Caftan is nice, God bless you and also the seamstress, it is nice, God bless you.
Fashion is elegance and beauty of all Moroccan women
I want a site about fashion design. Thank you.
This is very nice, great. I wished to wear one of these designs in my wedding. Khouloud from Tetouan.
You have to settle first the problems of bombs (Kamikaz) the sons of the people are dying.
Salam. My name is Mehdi Chanoun. I hope to get an opportunity to participate with you. Thank you, here is my number.
In this explosion, they could have forgotten a gas bottle, heater or bigger gas bottle.
I love you Nass El Ghiwane and love my dear country Morocco. May God bless you all.
El Ghiwane love from my heart. I love you, Nass.
We would like to study there. However, I would like to know how much it costs. Thank you very much.
We don't want our country to be like this with carts and people who eat stones.
I am from Kabylia. I am not proud of being Algerian. I say that haragas and young haragas are men. Long live France, long live Italy and Europe. Love for Algeria.
I love Nass El Ghiwane and wish you all happiness.
Salam. A militant salutation to all Sahrawis!
I would like to know the number of points for the last three years.
Hi everyone. I have before never liked any rap group until I heard you, I'm mad about you Mohsin, Meryam from Rabat.
Salam. Fnaire is the best group. They present to Moroccan young people the best thing ever in our authentic heritage. I'm from Larache. By God we love you so much, both young and old. Especially your song 'Lala Mnana' because here we have her mausoleum. I encourage you a lot.
Salam to all Moroccans. May God make you always proud, this is how I love you Fnair to triumph with Yed Lhena. Inchallah you'll be more. One more thing, we're with you always, all Morocco is with you. We love you. Long live Morocco. Always Imazighen.
Hi Fnair. The best group, I hope that you will always remain the best inchallah. I hope to meet you one day by God Meryam from Rabat.
Good!
You are the biggest servers of the oppressive Arab regime. Long live sheikh Oussama Ben Laden, God is the greatest.
Although I can't memorize what you say, I love you so much. Bye, Sanaa from Italy. Fnair (unclear: Italian) the friend of Sanaa.
Salam. How are you? I thank you for this nice radio. However, but you don't show one very nice country. But it is neglected. you must visit it very soon, ok.
Salam.
Salam. I am Rida. I am a car mechanic. I have a diploma from a vocational training centre in El Jadida. I thank officials in the vocational training centre very much.
Hi. I want to enroll in the vocational centre of Kenitra. Is there a branch of computer science?
I am a young man, 20. I am still confused about taking a decision to join the vocational training centre as I hold on to the school. Please help me take the right decision.
Salam. If you want to register in the vocational training, this is the site www.inscription-ofppt.ma
I am Issam from Morocco. I want to register in the vocational training. I have studied in the first year of the baccalaureate. I want to realize my future. How can I register and what are the necessary conditions to register? I am 20.
I am Hassan, I am 19 from Tangier. I don't like studies. I want to join vocational training. I want some advice.
There is nothing. Everything is lies. They are entertaining us with slogans and lies. We refer them to God.
I encourage all the people to go to their studies.
Salam. I want to know the requirements of Moukawalati. I want to set up a business. I want details please.
Cheb Khaled is always the best, in Agadir, Khaled was the star of this concert.
Salam alikum. I congratulate his majesty king Mohamed VI for this constitution. I consider that Tamazight is the main language because it will be reconciliation for us first of all and it is the language of origins. Therefore, it will be an exam and parties should be convinced about that. I also think that if they exclude this, the future of dear Morocco will be difficult. This will result in more racism and maybe even more. I don't wish to say this because we are concerned about this nice country and its great people. This is my suggestion. Salutations to you for this topic which concerns the nice people.
Bassma, I am Sara. I love you so much. You're a star. All Moroccans support you. Bye, nicest Bassma in the academy.
Salam Bassma, I see that it is only you who remain in the star. Ibrahim, take many kisses from Bassma. I hope you will remain close in the star academy. ok.
I wish you all failure.
Hi how are you. I like the students of star academy. We are from Morocco and were sad when Asmaa left because her departure was early because she is talented and has a nice voice. Now I ask you Diyaa to do all you can to achieve a good result and we are with you and hope that you will remain in that level in which we see you and go forward and not go back under any condition. I wish you and your friends success. I say to Saad take care of Diyaa because you make a nice duo and you suit each other in any video clip of any romantic song. Good luck friends.
For myself, I am tired because Maghreb star academy is very late. I ask Nessma TV to make it start quickly and not broadcast only in Ramadan and the Summer.
Moroccan weddings are great. There is nothing like them.
Marriage is a legitimate act ordered by God but "Allah does not impose upon any soul a duty but to the extent of its ability".
You're the best channel, you remind us of our country, I always wait for the Maghrebia.
I wish the good to all Arab countries.
Hi, thank you very much for this presentation. Even if we love rai a lot, the styles of the people of the east aren't much known in Europe, but there's the rai of Khaled, Sahraoui and the late cheb Hasni who had the angelic voice always present and presents Arabs. This is why we ask the people who have production companies to contribute with these young people to make progress. I hope from my heart and ask God that rai is part of us. It's not good to neglect it. Ok, we want a long interview of Cheb Hasni with his recent concerts and not the old. May God assist you, your friend Jamel from France.
Salam alikum. May God protect our country and all countries from catastrophes
I love you Amani, Marwa and Amani stars whatever happens. Tunisia Tunisia. Amouna.
You have mercy.
You left me, Antar Yahya. I wish you would have come with me. Anyway, give me his phone number. Congratulations anyway. We wish you happiness and everything. Congratulations you you you you you you!
Of course Bassma is the star. She has honoured all Moroccans. Long live Morocco.
Bahara beach.
Blessed holidays my Morocco; I love my country.
Blessed Achoura.
I believe in freedom but we shouldn't violate freedom of others. As for trading our bodies, this is the top of violating freedom of the other.
May God grant success to Marouane Chamakh. I am crazy for him. Can you give me his msn? I just want to be acquainted with him.
Salam everyone and to Chamakh. Anyway, Chamakh, you are the best player known by Morocco. Honestly, you are my favourite of all the players. I wish I were a player like you. If you want friends, this is my msn
I wish you could play in a Spanish team.
Hi, how are you. I am Safsafi Adil. I want to say to all Moroccans that Marouane Chamakh will play for English Newcastle, love Morocco, Chamakh
Hi Marwan, I'm Fatima. Bravo! You're the best player ever. Bravo!
I am a young man living in Spain. I am 23. I am looking for the method of raising poultry.
First of all, I thank this nice programme. I would like to work in professional driving. I have a driving license of the category B and C.
This is good.
I am a young man from Ouarzazate. I would like to set up a business for poultry farming. However, I don't know what to do. I work in a farm in Sousse. I have experience in poultry. I don't have any certificate proving this. I have been working in poultry farming for over 10 years. I hope you will send me an idea.
We thank you for this program you've presented to us
Hajar you're the star whatever happens, I love you so much Hajar Hajar Hajar
Fella, I love you. I will die for you, daughter of my country. You're the empress of Arab music. We'd die for you. We'll support you to the end, my dear Fella.
Hi, how are you, I love you so much Hajar and Ahmed and hope to see you bride and groom inchallah, Hajar can you sing to me 'Lhorm Ya rasol Allah'.
I condemn this code because it is not tough and it is not fair. Trucks which transport goods don't have tonnage. Some trucks, even when they are empty, are heavy. They cannot be overloaded. The minister of transport has to reconsider these trucks because they have not left her anything in tonnage.
Congratulations Hajar.
It is positive laws which have made us reach this scandal!
Honestly, violence is not necessary. However, even girls in these times no longer have any shame. With these almost naked clothes, they are damaging public freedoms. May God guide them, that's all!
I won't keep quiet until I hear news about Hamid. Hamid, if you visit this site, please contact me because you are my favourite artist. I downloaded all your songs from Star Academy, but I want to know whether you will continue singing or not. It is unfair that you don't continue. You're the best person that I saw.
Bring us Friday, Amimar.
Salam. May God protect you. Does anyone knows a site where there's anything about the results of the baccalaureate today, please?
I am Imane. I study in Oujda. This year's exams weren't doable for everyone, especially literature students. As for science students, it was better. I wish from all my heart success to everyone!
Salam! I wish success to everyone who will sit for the second session. Congratulations to those who passed the ordinary session! I study P.C. The physics exam was difficult. I hope the second session will be doable for students. I say it again, the ordinary session was tough. Good luck, everyone!
Please, I would like to know whether i passed or not. Please reply and look with me for the name Mustapha FAKRACH!
In my opinion, road accidents are caused by drivers who don't respect traffic laws. Stop blaming Moroccans. I read in a comment that it is Moroccans who aren't good drivers. Aren't you Moroccans? I say we should support our country and contribute to the development of the country. Let's change our behaviour.
I am not lucky!
I wish lots of success to the city of Zagora this year!
This is unacceptable! You will regret it, dogs! This is a loss for Arabs. I was shocked at his death. However, Kadhafi isn't dead. This is a trick of the Jews. He is not dead. O world, wake up from your sleep, Kadhafi is well and living, he is alive.
I'm a student in the first year of the baccalaureate. I don't know the best branch, is it the SVT or the PC? What are the prospects for everyone? I'm in Molay Ismail High sSchool in Ben Msik Sidi Otman.
Hi! I am a student of literature in the baccalaureate. I want you, please, to tell me about the best graduate schools and institutes in Morocco for students of literature. When are entry exams held this year, 2010?
I think that this phenomenon is widely-spread at schools. I advise parents to take care of their children and monitor them. They should be close to them. I wish everyone success.
I advise those who smoke and smokers to go to a specialist clinic for smokers located in Casa because it is harmful for the health. I hope you will follow my advice.
I know many schools which require high grades.
I would like to reply to the person who said that Tata is not a region of Amazigh people. I would like to say that in Tata there are Amazigh and Arab people, but mostly Amazigh. There is no difference between Amazighs and Arabs. We just have to be united and renovate our region Tata, not be racist, OK!
I want to reply to the guy who said that people in Tata aren't Amazigh. Who are they, then? Arabs are only concentrated in the centre because they work there. There's not a single Arab in Tata, OK?
Long live WAC and Morocco.
My name is Ihcen Mouklati. Thanks to the Moroccan abdelkebir Nichane for coming to the school of sidi Moumen!
By God these court orders have disappointed all Muslims who care about their religion, their God and their messenger. As for the called Khalid Sofyani who defends freedom of the press and opinion (defender of Jerusalem of Palestine), God and His messenger deserve more to be defended and supported. God suffices us and He is the best protector.
Saadane is great!
Salam alikum. Let's talk honestly first of all. When a girl shows her charms, she excites the man. But here, he doesn't have the right to do what he wants. As for stoning to death or anything else, everyone must hold himself accountable, his household, family, relatives and everyone close to him, then he can judge others. The Halal is clear and the Haram is clear. If you are seeking paradise, the way is clear. And if you want hell, the way is clear. Everyone should preserve himself and his honour. If you want to do something, you must do it through advice not criminality. In Islam, we never find anything about stoning to death or with the sword. It is all indulgence. If you seek the welfare of the Islamic Umma, you have to learn, study and know how to advise people not stone people. O Lord this is enormous! O Lord have mercy on us as we are weak. My Muslim brother, my Muslim sister, religion is advice. Salam alikum.
Congratulations Ilham.
Listen to me Libyans, now you think that the west is helping you. You are wrong. Why you are wrong? I will tell you that supposing you win the battle, who will rule the country. They will. If we suppose that Kadhafi sells them the country because this country is their goal. I will continue next time and tell you what is their goal? Ok, my friends!
You killed Kadhafi, the leader of America and defeater of zionists. You will regret your act. May God rest your soul in peace, o leader!
My name is Rabia. I am 15. I live in the city of Ksar Kebir. I play with Raja Kasri which plays in the league. I play in the defence. I am an excellent defender. I would like to join Mohamed VI academy God willing. I hope you will get in touch with me as soon as possible God willing.
For me, authentic Arabs are Arabs of the past who ride camels. I am talking about the master of the universe. But now, which Arabs are we talking about? About mercenaries? But the unified Amazigh people are certainly coming and Arabs will have to go back to the peninsula. Our civilization is noble and will remain so. We have pledged to God to protect Islam and we will be faithful to the pledge. Therefore, there is no justification for your presence. So leave this country to its owners!
Congratulations o people of Libya! By God, I felt very happy for you. I wish you a prosperous future to our friendly and dear Libyan people. I hope Islam, victory and freedom will spread in other countries o God!
May God grant victory to Seif Al Islam against the revolution of NATO rebels!
How are you Zahra? I am an athlete from Agadir. I want your help. Do you have the programme for the semi-marathon, if possible? Thank you!
The Sahara is Moroccan with the power of law and is imposed by the amalgamations imposed by globalization.
I love you so much nanousa
Your voice is great, but I hope you won't become arrogant like all Moroccan artists.
Salam thank you for this topic that concerns all Moroccans without exception. The forest is our refuge. By God, if you see a region called Taourirt, you would weep. They have made it like a shaved head after it was a forest full of trees.
May God protect you. I need the address of the association fighting violence against women in Casa.
The forest is an important element in life. Therefore, we have to support the idea of encouraging more forestation, teach our children as well how to preserve them. This is because God the Almighty offered them to us. Therefore, we must preserve them.
I would like to know the baccalaureate results.
O Lord grant success to every individual sitting for the exam!
I wish you success, God willing, everyone of you.
I hope the pass rate will be higher this year, God willing!
I hope there will be facilities for the students because there are many pressures. I hope the pass rate will be high, God willing!
I hope that examiners fear God. The regional exam is doing to us what it wants. Even if we wish we could, Allah is predominant over His affair.
Salam alikum. When will the exams of the baccalaureate be announced God willing?
I hope from those who correct exams to fear God in those who sit for exams, help them a little and avoid scoring a zero which is an eliminating grade. God grants success!
The baccalaureate degree is key to all prospects. The ones who pass thanks to their efforts will be successful. As for those who succeeded by cheating, they will remain dwelling on the shelves on university!
May God protect you my dear Amimer. For me you are an Olympic champion, you are a true man and person, son of my street. Long live Amimer. Long live Bourouba, Ammi Rabeh and the old woman, may God protect her.
It was America which did this terrorism by supporting terrorism and the Arab and Islamic world.
It's a shame, this is our country and we have to share its sufferings, May God punish them
Honestly, I like this site very much. Wishing you more work and perseverance. It is a great idea that you thought of setting up this site.
Salam. I am Younes from Morocco. I want to participate with you, thank you. I have a nice voice, by God.
I am a student in the tronc commun. I want explanations about the branch of Ste. Thank you.
Mustapha 26: Star Academy is the best programme I have watched in my life. But when the problem with Hajar occurred.
May God rest his soul in peace in that sleep, say amen!
This is the fate of every tyrant.
Salam alikum. I am an individual with a low income. I would like to know if there are flats in the province of Al Barnousi close to industrial zone or Anasi. I hope you will reply as soon as possible.
Long live CAB forever.
Bravo free people of Libya! I am Tunisian and I congratulate the Libyan people. Bravo!
Long live Jeunesse Batna CAB. They are the champions.
The exam is very nice. One should just have studied. By God it is easy. I have secured in Islamic education 19.5. Oh Lord grant me success and to all students, amen my Lord.
I am greatly thrilled with this show to include my homeland, Morocco. My sister would like to participate!
Honestly, I have a house, but the plan is not registered. I want to take out a loan, but I don't have the collateral required by the bank, except the work of my husband. What can I do now? I need 50,000 dirhams. Sorry for writing in the Moroccan dialect. I hope you'll reply as soon as possible.
Ok, you're lucky with that sister Mearyam, may God keep you always like this. It's not just that I understood you, I understooooood you. And as you said, we've not come here to insult each other and from what I see I'm not welcomed by you.
I say to this group, talk until next year. Who will care about you then? Why listen to you? Why do we listen to them?
I am very impressed with you. I wish you the best. I wish you more achievements. My greetings to you, very much. Wishing you success, God willing.
Fnaire are good young men. Inchallah, they will bring pride to Morocco through rap. But they must make new albums so that they acquire world fame. Thank you Fnaire, well done.
God willing, it'll be good!
Oh yes, Fnaire forever, and long live Fnaire.
I hope to pass this year. Congratulations to those who passed. Actually I couldn't hold my tears. It is worth great efforts and hard work.
I am Yosra from Tunisia, baccalaureate of maths. I had a score of 16 and I am very happy because I had 16. Praise be to God. A high rate of math students in the bac passed. Thank you.
I tell you Hayati, you and sister Bouchra that everyone expresses his opinion in his own way and we have come to this site to encourage them and wish them a successful career, to be successful always. Ok. I hope that my comment won't upset you, and thank you. A kiss to everyone.
Congratulations to the great group. I'm proud of you in Spain, you're always on top. The sons of Morocco are always on top with the sons of Marrakech. I offer your new album to my love Hanan and all the Moroccan people from Tangier to the Moroccan Sahara. Do you speak Spanish? Bye, XO.
Salam alikum. We hope this law will be implemented and it will be welcomed by all the people God willing so that it will bring light to all the houses. May God reward you with all the good for this great site!
You are the most beautiful singer in the world!
Hi Nawale Bouzlaf is great. May God protect her.
I love star so much and hope to enter the star this coming year with the will of God.
The star academy is nice, very nice.
Salam Dia. How are you darling? You have lifted the head of Morocco with your dialect and the Academy without you is valueless. I tell you that Saad loves you. Transmit my greetings to everyone. Lamyaa from Morocco.
I am from Morocco and I am concerned about its girls. I think that Asma didn't do anything and lift the head of Morocco.
By God, we wish all the good for Libya in the post-Kadhafi era. Just be united and forget the near past. Enough hatred and division inside the one people and one nation. Peace be upon dear Libya!
Thank you for this great site. I am one of those who benefited from the information provided in it. My brother also thanks you.
I would like to join Barça.
I love football.
By God I like Matmour, my love, so much!
The sister of Ziani is ugly, but he is more handsome than she is. She married him just for fame and luck. We can't guess she is the sister of Ziani. God blesses with graces those who can't appreciate them. I'm a beautiful girl, but I'm not lucky. Only miserable men propose to me. 1, 2, 3 viva Algeria!
Salam alikum. Terrorism in Morocco is widely-spread. We the people of Morocco must try to stop this. Thank you!
My dreams are coming true. Thank you.
A great port! Is there any job? I am a welder.
In reply to Tonono, is it a neighbor's duty to tell his neighbour? Your expressions and ideas emanate from racism and ignorance. You must change your ideas in order to unite Muslims instead of insulting your free masters. Long live Morocco without people like you.
These are men.
I liked this nice article. Thank you for it.
I vote for Hajar and Hamid 2 3
Good evening everyone, I'm fatiha from Abu Jaad, my greetings to all candidates namely Hajar, you're the stars with all the meaning of the word, and also Ahmed, you're a star.
I hope you will present philosophy of the first year of the baccalaureate in experimental sciences.
Congratulations to Libya, congratulations!
This is not a celebration. It is dance and joke of Arabs for Jews. This is a victory for Jews. O Arabs, go to sleep!
I love Basma so much as well as Yahya. I love Ilon. May God protect you for each other, Basma and Yahya. I say to Khawla that she should stay away from Nasir because he wasn't so much loved.
The Sahara issue is considered as a question of ignorance for Moroccans because both peoples are Arab. We wish the independence of the Sahraoui people.
Everything is for money. Real Moroccanism and national spirit no longer exist.
Salam. I hope that officials reply to this question. When will the Moroccan football qualify and when can we dream of the World Cup even by qualifying to it?
The problem is with mediators who surround the Moroccan football. But it is the Moroccan people who pay the price. God suffices us and He is the best protector against them. I think the problem is not that of the coach.
Bassma, you did the Maghreb proud. May God ease your path in everything.
Bassma, you have disgraced Morocco.
Bassma, I love you.
I don't appreciate what he did. However, God will take revenge. There is no other god but God, Mohamed is the messenger of God.
Bassma I love you so much. Can you take care of Ibrahim? If it were Badir, but Yahya loves you so much moon.
Salam. I am a young man from the city of Khouribga. I dropped out of school from the first year of the lower secondary. I would like to join vocational training. Is this possible? I am now unemployed. Thank you!
Salam alikum. I still study in the baccalaureate. I would like to do vocational training. But I don't have an ID card. Is it necessary? When will registration time expire? Thank you!
Salam alikum. My greetings to you. I am a young man, 20. I studied up to the third year of the lower secondary. I failed three times. A mathematics teacher used to expel us all the time. Now they have expelled me from school. I would like to study vocational training. I want you to help me, may God rest the souls of your parents. We are citizens of Morocco, we are not going to leave abroad.
Salam. My name is Mohamed from Imouzzer. I would like to ask a question about vocational training. I dropped out of school on 10/07/2008. I have studied up to the eight year. Can I join vocational training?
Salam alikum. I would like to ask about tourism centres and whether they are good. This is because I don't know what to do. I want to specialise in a good domain. If anyone has an idea, please advise me. Thank you very much!
We thank you for this great programme. I wish success to all participants including me. I hope I will be accepted in the training, God willing as I don't like studies because of my level. I know this is not true.
Salam. I am Hajar from Beni Mellal. I would like to join vocational training. What should I do?
I would like to sit for the exam of vocational training. Some guys told me that I should sit for exam first, then register. But it is impossible for me to come at the date of the exam. Is there any solution?
Please help me! Thank you for your inquiry. I would like to join vocational training. I have studied up to the fourth year of the lower secondary.
You must involve the public opinion in this attempt.
Salam sister, if he is a foreigner, married and not yet divorced, it is impossible for you to marry him. My sister had the same problem as he didn't have divorce papers, the judge rejected the case. I hope this helps.
Praise be to God. I am Tunisian. I support and encourage having a higher number of children. This was recommended by Mohamed, peace and prayer of God be upon him. If this has of course no negative impact on the health of women. I am 24 and have two children. I am for having more children.
We are always brothers. However, this time we will defeat you because we are lions not sheep. Lions forever 0-3 God willing!
Hi, how are you ok, I love you all
I am a Moroccan woman. I married a foreigner who married a second wife without my knowledge in Morocco. So what can I do. I would like to file a suit in the court here abroad. I need your advice. I live abroad.
how are you Abdelhamid bravo bravo bravo Morocco forever forever Tangier the bride of the north
Long live Hajar, go ahead don't go back like Hamid, Amine from Kenitra Morocco
The bac seems like life and death for young people. I am Moroccan and I have the right to live in my country with or without the bac. I think the bac is the cause of delinquency and illegal immigration. Finally, one must live. I want a reply
Salam everyone. Just one word to baccalaureate students. I wish them success and perseverance with hard work.
Ha, these Moroccans are shameless! Passing rates are 38% rising by 34% from last year!! Was the passing rate 4% last year or what? The ministry itself is stupid and they want students to succeed! May God save us from this! Enough exaggeration!
Salam alikum. My sister is disabled. She doesn't go to school. Now we want to take her to some school to study and learn. We don't know where to go. If possible, please help me if you know some school.
We're very happy that you have shed light on this issue because the hijab is an obligation for all Muslims. May God assist you.
In the name of God. I'm very happy with this site. The veil is compulsory for every Muslim woman, so why all these grudges? In Islam, we're all brothers so we have to tackle all issues with delicacy as belief is in the heart and we should abide by it. May God assist you. Salam.
Why was the series 'My three sisters' broadcast and not continued?
Peace and blessings of God be upon our messenger and beloved Mohamed, peace and blessings be upon him.
There is nothing.
We must act against them with all the means we have. We shouldn't keep quiet about this.
I am Abdlilah from Morocco. I salute all the Islamic Umma. Happy Eid Al Adha to all Muslims. I salute the Tunisian and Libyan people for this protest in favour of our dear and master Mohamed (peace and blessings be upon him).
Long live Nasro Souidi so much, there is a site for Cheb Nasro, it is: nasro on ..., thank you to the fans of Cheb Nasro.
This is a good topic.
There is no life for what you're calling for.
Long live Tawssna Tamazight, long live Azal.
Go and look for another policy, you've worn us out with this one. Ok Mr al-Qaeda, hhhhhhhh, Moroccans have uncovered you.
Morocco witnessed awful terrorism on May 16th.
The only man in Arabia is dead, he moved America and Israel and...He's Saddam Hussein, may God have mercy on him. But al-Maliki (expletive) the Iraqi isn't an Iraqi president, may God assist Bin Ladin and Ayman Dawahir, I greet you from Morocco.
Salam, how are you, I'm Sara I want for my travel a good goodbye happy new year bye
I would like to join women's team of Raja of Casablanca please!!
Hi, how are you, may God help you.
Salam, thank you for the programme.
Everything can be changed with the will of God.
Everything for rap and those who don't like us, his hand in his big mouth.
A goalless match.
We are people who think we are developed in our mentality, but this is not true.
Rap music is something very nice for us. With my greetings to the city of Fes, Fnair, H-Kayne, Bigg and Abd Razak. Farhan from Fes, Tahriyn Albir Street.
Look brothers, this sport is not given importance in Morocco. Salam.
Religion is life. Islam is love. Islam is love and compassion. Everything that goes beyond this is disbelief and hypocrisy. What happens now is sedition, hypocrisy and clashing with authorities. Anyone who alleges to belong to the righteous Salaf and causes this sedition is a hypocrite, a disbeliever and an ignorant of the sciences of religion, he works at the service of criminal people and gets a salary for that.
I have an exam on Wednesday 17 in this month. I study in the lower secondary in the city of Tetouan. Pray for me to pass.
This topic is nice. It covers everything we need in our studies. In addition, I think it expresses even more the feeling of Moroccans towards foreigners. This reflects that in Morocco there is co-existence between religions.
Salam alikum my brothers. By God I was scared before the exam especially about English. However, praise be to God, it was doable. But history and geography, I was getting mad. I don't know which topic to choose in history. I wish success to everyone.
This topic is nice and interesting at the same time. I thank this site for this broad culture.
This topic is very nice as it talks about co-existence between religions in Morocco and other countries. This is tolerance. Viva Morocco! It is the best country.
May God assist everyone who works for good!
Salam cousin! How are you? By God I miss you so much. I hope you will reach us. I love you so much! I watched the film of Italy. I liked it so much. I wish you success and more works! Please reply, I am waiting! Bye, take care!
Salafists are mentally backward.
The Sahara is Moroccan, it'll never be for the enemies, our Sahara is always Moroccan.
I don't approve of the shows you present. We want singing competitions.
Just tell me where are these associations? Or do they just want to show off? All these rights you're talking about and lying don't exist. It seems you just seek your personal interests.
The Sahara is Moroccan and will remain Moroccan.
Hajar, transmit my best greetings to Khairi and Ahmed. I am from Morocco.
I have a domestic problem with my wife. We quarreled, she left home angry and I don't know where she's gone. She has left me with 5 kids. I've been looking for her but haven't found her.
Salam. I am a woman victim of severe domestic violence by m husband. I want please officials to help me. May God protect you!
Salam alikum. I have a sister, by God this is enormous! Her husband is a renown drug dealer. I can see he has no human qualities. He practices on her all forms of physical and moral violence. For example, he comes home drunken, he breaks and insults to unacceptable degrees. He insults the whole family with very hurting words. But poor woman she is bearing all this. Moreover, her educational level is low. He has money and wants to deprive her even from her family. He tries to make her go without anything. Anyway, he applied for divorce. To all Moroccans, please guide us to a solution!
I don't like this method because it is hideous.
Look, honestly there is no education in these times. There is just favouritism. I personally despaired of studies. In 2008, I failed in the bac. By God I haven't sit again for the exam. I studied life and earth sciences. Now, praise be to God, I work in an agency as secretary. Things go well. What madness. If Morocco encouraged us and teachers understood us, we would have done well. There is just fraud. Salam.
Salam alikum. How are you, I wish you success all for those who passed and those who didn't. Thank you. Bye. (Agadir, Ait Melloul).
Oh Lord!
Salam alikum. I hope the second session will be a little easy so that we can pass and if possible give us samples of the second session so that we can have an idea. Thank you for this site.
Hi. please make the second session easy in order to pass even with 10. Many of us have died, may God rest their souls. Don't make it very difficult. Thank you. I will pray for you. Accounting subject was very tough (delegation of Anfa). Thank you.
Hey, I was shocked when I failed and all my friends passed except me. Anyway, I will sit for the second session. But they were unjust to us and many failed.
Salam alikum. It is true that security has progressed in Algiers which offers tranquility and safety. But I just want to say to this official there are 48 provinces in Algeria which need protection not just at the door of your house. Thank you!
Mohamed Chokri is an author who deserves respect because he wrote about his real life with audacity.
So many billions and still nothing. These billions, I tell you where they will go: to the pockets of ministers. The minister of finance is the biggest thief on earth.
There is no author like Mohamad Chokri. He was known by many poets and he has strong books like "Bare bread" which I never saw any book like it and no poet can write his biography. Long live Mohamad Chokri the Rifian and long live Rifians. Salam.
Respects to this man who wrote about the short life he lived in the North of Morocco. Thank you.
I am French and my husband is Moroccan. He always insults me, and I've done nothing to him. He humiliates me. And the last time he hit me in front of our children. I don't know what to do anymore. I am too hurt inside. I am only staying with him for my children.
I'm French and he's Moroccan. He insults me with all sorts of names. He tells me that he doesn't care if I die. Last time, he almost strangled me in front of our two children.
Salam alikum. I am a young girl from Casablanca. I have a problem. I was going home by night. The son of neighbours cut my way and threatened me with a knife. There were 2 guys with him. They raped me. I need help if possible.
What are their telephone numbers?
Mohammed is the messenger of God, there is no other God but Allah.
Salam alikum my brothers and sisters. Happy Ramadan and enjoy your ftour!
I am Moroccan. I wish victory to the best team. Liyochacharif. Arab football is going ahead in Africa. They are brothers Mor=Alg.
May God guide them! This is unacceptable! O people, fear God!
I love Atlas Lions and wish them victory over Algeria 1-0.
O Berber people, don't give up your rights and your language!
We Sahraoui people feel at ease with the Moroccan kingdom but we don't trust officials from Morocco and Algeria
Great, you've served the nation.
There is no union if the problem of the Sahara persists.
I adore MCA. I love it so much. I love Mouloudia, with the will of God, may God protect you for us forever. I love you.
I love the Mouloudia. Long live Badji Younes Bouguech, all my mind my sweetness.
Moamer Kadhafi is above America and NATO. He will win the challenge. God, Moamer, Islam and Libya alone!.
There is no other God but God, Mohammed is the messenger of God! O Lord show Jews some black day and support your messenger, o God!
I love my country, its people although unfair are noble. Long live Algeria and long live our robbers, how are you deserted Morocco?
This is good.
You see, those who did this don't know the value of our prophet.
I understand nothing. Islam is the religion of peace. The messenger of God has left a way for those who can struggle. We shouldn't let an idle film make us lose our temper. This is just sedition.
Hell is bigger than what you think. God will take revenge on you very soon, God willing. Hey, dogs, let prostitutes die of the shame of Aids, syphilis, gonorrhoea… Leave them alone and don't help them. Those who help them will secure a place next to them in hell. Aren't you Muslims?
1, 2, 3 viva Alg!
These are very nice ideas. Thank you!
Well-done for the change.
The police has nothing to do, now they are just preying on us.
God is sufficient for us and He is the best disposer of affairs.
Long live Algeria, may God have mercy on the martyrs, long live Algeria, a greeting to all Algerians in Charba.
Nice topic, very good!
Salam I'm (Biti) from the western region Nador, I love Fnair so much and wish them success in their artistic career. I always follow their news. I ask them if they want to give me their msn. Thank you.
This is the style in which Morocco is progressing. Fnair have pertinent things to say. May God protect them. Long live Fnair.
These are nice and new articles.
Bassma, you're very beautiful. I personally die for you because you honour Morocco with your great voice. I hope you will sing me a Moroccan song.
I would like to get the number of points of social security.
Very good.
I have been working for 9 months in a company. But I found only two points in my account. Can I contest such points if I sue them legally? Thank you!
I thank everyone who contributed directly or indirectly to setting up this site for the communication of most participants. Thank you very much!
It will be successful, God willing.
Salam alikum. I am a pupil studying in the baccalaureate. I want to register in a vocational training centre but I don't know what to do. What is your advice for me and students like me. I study in the arts branch. Please inform us and open opportunities for us. God bless you. We hope that we won't disappoint you. Thank you.
Salam alikum. I am a pupil. I study in the baccalaureate. I want to register in a a vocational training centre but don't know what to do. What is your advice to me and pupils like me? Please inform us and offer an opportunity to us. God bless you. We hope not to disappoint you. Thank you.
Salam alikum. My name is Rachid from Kenitra. I would like to know if there any prospects for these institutions. Is there a guaranteed work after getting the diploma?
My name is Issam Obla from the city of Tiznit. I would like to join the academy Mohamed 6. I am 16. I am needy.
I want the Moroccan national team to win.
Shame on you. This is unacceptable and a shame on you my brothers, you don't make cannabis. It has destroyed our country. This is the truth. This is the life of all Moroccans. This is what I can say my brothers. For me, I cannot be separated from it. It is everything in my life. Without it, there is nothing.
Please forget this title because you've disturbed me
Tell him to make roads of Switzerland then he can bring the law of France. This minister, Mr **** might be insane or what?
Morocco has a lot of poverty that we must fight!
Good luck.
Haifa I love you so much, don't care about those who are against you I love you and I always try to dress like you and be like you
Bravo Nessma channel 10/10
I love you Nessma so much...I'm crazy for you
God willing we will win tomorrow, God willing.
Algeria.
I hope so.
Salam. I am Fatima Zahra. The exam was doable but most students don't rely on their own efforts. This threatens the position of others who rely on their own means. I hope that correctors will adopt in correcting the approach of writing not copying.
Marriage of under-age girls is one of the most important issues facing the Umma. So who are these parents who want their Umma to be ruined? Are we still living in the pre-Islamic era or what? Who are these parents who want their daughters to marry while still young and they know nothing about this life?
Since all this is true Mr minister and the health sector is miserable, why do you want to make things worse and introduce to the sector anyone like private nurses?
Honestly Moroccan programs of this Ramadan are very poor and uninteresting. Just words. Honestly, they are mocking us with this mess of programs. Wherever there is a bad Mexican film they bring it. That Haj Azzouz isn't funny. It is all a mess.
It is not bad, it is ok.
Morocco is a fair and free state. It will always remain free whether you like it or not. Long live the king! We have always been men. This terrorist is just a guinea pig.
Salam alikum 1.2.3 viva Algeria! No, no, no to war of Algeria!
Salam. I hope that the Arab Umma be one hand.
Enemy of God, the dog and demon!
We thank you for this article and wish you more success. I hope you will discuss the catastrophe and not film of Haj Azzouz. Thank you. Blessed Ramadan.
When will results of customs exams be announced?
When will the customs entry exam will be held?
We don't fear Drokdal.
Bassma, you deserve to be a star. You're far more beautiful than them. Anyway, may God grant you success nicest Bassma. A kiss, you have enlightened Morocco. I love you so much darling.
Bassma is a star and she will always remain a star in the eyes of all the people, a star.
I am a student. I passed the baccalaureate this year with a fairly good pass in physical sciences. I don't know what to do. Please help me!
Look Bassma, even if you haven't won, you're a star.
Bassma, don't be sad. I am Houda from Morocco. I die for you. I love you. You're the light of my eyes. I die for you. Your beauty is great. It drives me crazy. You're a great person.
1, 2, 3 viva Tayb Al Biyae, Gayo and Marwan Tola!
Well, well, not well without my country, better than the country of others!
Viva people of El Bahara, viva my brother so much and you I love you!

Salam. I would like to know the name of a clinic specialized in plastic surgery to remove grease from the abdomen. Thank you!
Salam. My name is Lakbira. I live in Italy. My problem is the following. I have been married for nine years. I have a child, he is six. When my child was born, the attitude of my husband has changed. Now he humiliates me, he stays up late in soirées with women. He bears no responsibility as a man of a household. Now he has to pay pension for two years. What is the solution in your opinion? How can I divorce? I have evidence showing his humiliation. Please reply as soon as possible. Thanks to family code in the Arab Maghreb.
I am Hassan from Zagora. I am 24. My hope is to set up a business in construction, God willing! Now, please I need your help in telling me what to do and what requirements are necessary for this small business, necessary papers and places where I should go to. Please advise me in this field with total honesty. I am sure that anyone who relies on God, God will not disappoint him. I am very happy my brothers to seek your advise, my brothers in God. The messenger, peace and blessings of God be upon him, spoke the truth when he said "Anyone who seeks advice won't be deceived." Please reply to me, make God grant you all your wishes!
I work two jobs. I am a construction electrician and carpenter. I need some support. Thank you!
I am a young man who wants to set up a business in a field where I have experience. I don't know how to start up this business. I hope that everyone who has experience or any idea to help me with an idea. I ask God to help anyone who has experience or will.
May God curse you! A programme of lies, not Moukawalati! It is just a game in order to enable them to loot funds. There is no warranty of the state or anything. People are going to prison because of Moukawalati programme!
My name is Said Ait Lahcen. I am a Moroccan young man. I am 21. I would like to join Moukawalati programme to help me in an agricultural project. I also have experience in this field. I also have a farm. I just need a loan to begin work even if the amount of the loan is small. The most important is to begin my project. Thank you! I wish you success, God willing!
Salam. Hi Basoom, the nicest voice in the academy; look I sing to Yahya I love you so much.
Hi, how are you. I am Karim from Guercif. Nasro intricated me and in spite of this I tell him long live Nasroooooo
Try to understand better, because in our Morocco there are many stupid people.
Hi. Aicha loves Nasro to death, but I understand him so much. I thank him so much for the wonderful voice and I think of you every day. You're great.
I hope that you will insert the results of the baccalaureate 2008 for this year for Morocco please.
I want to attend Mawazine festival in Rabat
Long live Cheb Nasro and may God rest the soul of Cheb Hassni.
If only they meet their demands of paying ransoms. Thank you!
Salam alikum all, as our ancestors said, by God, there is no one like Cheb Bilal. For me, he is pride 100%. Bilal forever, Bilal pride.
Fear God, o you who encourage vice in the name of modernity!
Nasro, I like your songs so much. I listen to your songs even when I was young. I hope that you will produce more works and let us hear some great songs. I wish you success from my heart, from Mohamed
I want plastic surgery on my nose. Can you help me?
This is a shame!
For many young people, this is an important topic.
Smoking is hazardous for the health. Students say smoking calms nerves. You are wrong! I am 20, I don't care about this, ok.
Good luck everyone.
I wish success to all the brothers. Wishes of success God willing in the second session. May God grant us success, oh Lord.
I don't like that celebration because they don't host Amazigh artists. Why, because I am an Amazigh woman and I am more proud of them than of this nonsense and nude dancers, even if Agadir is the capital of Souss.
Salam. I am an Algerian young graduate. I respect all my rights. I just would like to say to our Moroccan brothers that the Algerian people have no interest in Western Sahara or in anything else. Political border is closed but between the Algerian people and Moroccan people it is open. This message is understood by our brothers there. If Algeria were ok as they say, its sons wouldn't have immigrated illegally. They bear sour living conditions in Spain because in Algeria it is even worse.
Dear Nass El Ghiwane! you are in my heart all the time!
I like the Siham group
I am a retired worker. I have two words. The government must reconsider calculations with previous workers registered in this fund from A to Z. Then everything will be clear.
Wow Nancy is great over everyone even if they say bad things about you and in some sites they show you naked, this is very bad.
This woman should cover herself so that God would love her.
To say the truth, young girls should take into consideration the feelings of young men and choose decent clothes especially because we are in a Muslim country and also given the economic situation which makes many people incapable of marrying. As for the calls of some secular human rights associations, this is fanciful and cannot be implemented in our Muslim country. These associations should go to secular countries and spread their poisons there. As for our Islam, it is protected by the promise of God. As for what these guys did, it is not associated in any way with Islam and we cannot call them salafists because our religion is a religion of advice. They should have covered her with a cloak not remove her clothes.
Hi, how are you, I don't understand national football.
Salam alikum. I am Moroccan. For me, my country is better than a thousand countries! Where have our resources gone? These are the resources of our country. I tell you no matter how we speak out, we are people who are tenants in our country! I have been living outside my country for 14 years for one reason because I didn't find a future in my country because of robbers. What I see in my country, I never saw it in any other country in terms of resources granted to us by God. Still, we young people are lost in our country. But when foreigners come, they prosper. There are so many young people who have completed their studies by finally they are selling potatoes if they can! We are kind people. However, parliamentarians are dogs and usurped money of the people. I support the king because no matter how hard he controls, he can't control everything. Moreover, everything is summed up in politics. Thank you!
I love you Hajar. I wish you every success. I also love Asmaa Bassit- I ask everyone who voted for Hajar to vote for Asmaa plz. Long live Morocco. I hate Diaa because she offended Asmaa. She called her a monkey! I hate Diaa.
I love Hajar to death. May God grant you success. You're the star of the great Maghreb and you will always remain the star.
The homeland is one there is just one point Arabs don't like Amazigh people, why, because Arabs are racists what do they call to Berber people in Morocco, they call them all Mohamed; for us Mohamed is a very great name for us, we like it because it is the name of the prophet peace and prayer upon him. For them, Mohamed is a low thing. Please forgive me. Tamazight forever to death.
Moamer Kadhafi is a liar.
Hi, God be with you and may you be one of the girls who honour Morocco.
Morocco is one undividable country!
Long live Algeria , long live BBA, long live Ziani.
In fact, Rachid El Ouali is a permanent actor, but Moroccan cinema is very weak. With my respects to the opinions of everyone.
Hajar is a star whatever happens and we'll not let anyone touch her dignity, and if you have no pride, come for a tour in Morocco, ok. Long live Moroccans and long live Hajar.
Salam, I love Rachid Al Wali, I wish him success. Happy new year 2008. I hope that he will direct a film this year 2008.
I am a student in the first year of the baccalaureate economics. I want to know the best branch to follow in economic sciences this year.
I wanted to tell you my problem but you made me forget the problem.
Salam. I study in the third year of the elementary. I chose the branch of technology. My score is 13.55. I have a problem in the French language. I want to ask you whether my choice is right because my wish is to become an engineer.
I am a student. I had 16 in the class exam and 13 in the regional exam. I am confused about choosing SVT or PC. Please help me. Thank you.
Salam. I am a student in the high school Al Khawarizmi T.C.S. I chose the subject of economics. I hope to study well and be brilliant. However, most students criticize this subject under the pretext that it has limited horizons. They encourage me to substitute it. I don't know whether it is a good subject. I had a good score in maths and I am willing to study it. Thank you.
Peace of God be upon you. I am a young girl who studies in the second year of the secondary. I like the subject of Islamic education and want to choose it at university. However my sister tells me that no one succeeds in this subject. Anyone who studies it stays at home without a job. Are there no jobs for this subject which is the basis of the life of Muslims? In turn I hope from the ministry of education to provide jobs especially for brilliant students. I hope this.
Long live Algeria! We are the grandsons of Emir Abdelkader. If you like it, great; if you don't, go beat your head against a wall.
I want to study for the exam; what should I begin with?
Praise be to God.
This is an ideal change in the monetary policy in Morocco. I share this huge change with my Moroccan brothers.
Salam. Please, I want a loan without interest to buy a house. Is there a solution? If so what are the conditions to get it?
I love Haifa to death!
I would like to know why they haven't shown on TV pictures of terrorists who were arrested in Amgala.
Work is a form of worship.
Kadhafi is a dog.
Moamer Kadhafi is lofty, may God protect them!
I am a young man and father of a family. However, I don't have a permanent job. I work in the sector of painting. My income is not that good. I am 23. I hope from God to help me find a job outside the country since there is nothing to do inside the country.
Work is worship if it is in the context of the human aspect and human rights context.
Salam. I want a job as driver, welder or security guard. Thank you!
I am looking for a job in the field of construction. I am a metal worker.
I hope everyone will get a job and a decent life.
Salam alikum. I would like to work with you in any field especially as security guard.
What is the main reason preventing the integration of Amazigh language into the education system.
I want the number of Diae, I love you Diaa,Asma, Adnane. It is a pity that you should leave so early.
Diaa, I am Karima from Morocco. I love you so much, you, Saad, Mhamad and Chahi. A kiss. I want a song by the voice of Dyaa ok. You are the star of Morocco, certainly Ahmad, Saad or Abdalah a star.
Peace, mercy and the blessings of God upon you. Now I will start, I love Star Academy and want the phone numbers of the students, i.e. Asmae Atalbi. Is it possible for you to provide her email? Thank you so so much if you can help me with the email, if you want, if you don't mind.
I am dying for Diaa and I ask every Moroccan and Arab to vote to her please. Diaa is a star. Long live Morocco. Rabat forever.
There is no power and no will but from God!
Kadhafi took his right. My Lord God granted him his right in hell. This is his reward. Everyone was happy when Kadhafi died because Kadhafi was oppressing them. If I were them, I would be.
God bless.
Hi Dounia! This is my first year in the secondary. I choose humanities but this year I don't know the right choice, because my grade point average is not higher than 12. I hope to find a solution because I need your help. Thank you!
Hello, my name is Abdeillah Tiyane. I am a fan of Nass Elghiwane. I am a member of a newly created band from Hay Mohammadi in Casablanca that will seek to express the sufferings and injustice that the Moroccan people is enduring. Good luck!
I love Nass Elghiwane tremendously. I love Gnawa and Nass Elghiwane the best of whose songs I love most is "Nahla Shama" which revived their legacy. I loooove yoooouuu. Long live these two genres
Thank you.
Terrorism doesn't exist in Islam, they call Islamists terrorists and this is unacceptable.
We want Zaki. He is the one who will lift the national team, Zaki!!
You're really a virile man because you married an Algerian woman. Congratulations!
Really good articles. I hope that you will keep on in this way and publish varied articles like this one because it is really outstanding.
OCS forever.

A call to Al Jazeera: don't talk much about futile things in the eyes of the people.
O Lord don't punish us for the acts of ribald people, o Lord!
Begging is a threat to society. I ask officials to fight this phenomenon.
Bassma is a star and will remain a star. I want to watch the first clip Laili.
I love Badou Zaki and Nadir Myarri because they are the best coach and the best goalie.
Salam. How are you? God bless you! Fès always encourages you.
Basma, you have a nice voice. God bless you! I hope to see you because I like you so much. You're very nice!
Hi Basma! I am from Morocco. I love you so much. You a kind and nice person. I would like to tell you to stay with Yahya because he deserves you and he loves you so much unlike Ibrahim. Ok, bye, kisses!
God is the greatest! Mohamed, peace and blessings of God be upon him is the messenger.
Basma, I love you so much, you, Yahya and Brahim. God willing you will make an album which will have great success. I love you so much. I love you Basma. Zahra from Morocco.
I would like to know information about vocational training with the baccalaureate level in sciences and first level in the baccalaureate. Please guide me what to do for the first year of the baccalaureate science and what I can do. Please reply!
I would like to join vocational training in mechanics.
I would like to join vocational training in mechanics. However, I don't have studied up to the level of the ninth year of the lower secondary. I have studied only up to the seventh. Is there any help?
My name is Chaimae Messaoudi. I don't know what to do. Is there any advice please!
I am a young girl, 17. I would like to go to vocational training. But I don't know if registration is still possible now.
Salam. My name is Aziza. I would like to know which subject I can choose.
Salam. I am a young girl, Moroccan citizen. I am 21. I have a baccalaureate degree in literature. I would like to join this training in OFPPT. I sat for the exam but I didn't pass. I chose the field of technical sales agent. I liked this field.
Peace, mercy and blessings of God be upon you. I would like to comment the topic of the Moroccan sister whose divorce is sought as a result of their accusations that she does witchcraft. I ask the sister to mandate her problem to God the Almighty. She must pray and implore God. God doesn't like oppressors. Fatima Zohra from Oujda, Morocco. Salam alikum.
I am a young Moroccan man, 21. I am still studying in the institution of applied technology HH2. I swear by God, if anyone misses the opportunity to benefit from this, you should know that you will regret it. Wish you success, God willing.
My brothers, I would like to know if literature students have horizons in vocational training something which is in demand in the country. If there is any information, please advise us. Thank you!
Salam. I passed the bac 2010 in the ordinary session. I got 7.61 in the regional exam of the sixth. I had 14.65 in the class exam. I studied hard history and geography, philosophy, I studied all positions and lessons. Finally I passed. But I found nothing useful to do after the bac. You study hard and you sit home. This is what we have in Morocco.
I want some pictures of the motorway from Casa to Safi.
Salam to all candidates, namely the Moroccans Hajar, Farah and Abdou, and I love you, but beware of enemies, be careful a lot, my greetings to Firas, Farid, Yousra and Donya
I wasn't lucky in the ordinary session. But I hope from God the Almighty to catch up in the second session and pass it, especially because I only needed a few points to pass. I wish success to all candidates, God willing!
How are you? My name is Zineb. I study in the fourth year of the secondary. I like what you write here. I ask God to make exams easy for me and for everyone. I would like to pass this year. I am very sad.
May God help us this year!
They are sons of the country and sons of good origins. Moreover, no one supports this tyrant.
Hi I'm Khaoula from Morocco, I encourage Hajar, Abdelhamid, Farah and Kawtar a lot and good luck to all, I wish them a good success inchallah, and I test Firasse and Toraya
Peace of God be upon everyone. Honestly, the Moukawalati programme is good. We ask God to grant success to everyone who took the initiative. We hope that officials will facilitate procedures so that young people can get out from the shell of unemployment. Thank you everyone.
Hi, honestly you're great. God willing, we'll also play football.
I hope the problem in Marrakech will be solved so that we can join the league as well. We have talents in Marrakech. Therefore we ask the federation and officials to consider this issue. We thank the manager of the team of Fekih Ben Saleh for granting us an opportunity to play with his team. We hope we won't disappoint him. Thank you and thanks to all participants in this site. I hope there will be a reply to the topic.
Hi. I am Sana. I used to play for the team Rachad El Bernoussi. Now I'm looking for a team to play with. I live in Casa. I have been playing since 2005. I want to play on a team because this is not a profession, it is just a hobby. But I want to make progress. I hope a team will call me.
I hope this year God will grant success to Ain Herrouda team. It is the first team for which I played in the national league. Just this year, I have moved to my city, Tangier. I wish them a successful career, especially the league of the North.
In the name of God. I have a comment. I am really happy because the current chairman of the federation is a sportsman. This is what will make him feel our concerns, especially because he is from Safi. But this doesn't prevent me from warning him about the division they are creating, which negatively affects many teams, especially outlying teams such Safi. When it goes to play with Laâyoune, for example, it endures many hardships including the expenses and the remoteness. This means it's not a real championship. We hope that officials will show their real support to this championship and that this will be rewarding. The hardest thing is the beginning. I wish success to all the girls.
We pray for those who do such acts and tell them may God guide you to the light of Islam because they don't know the value of the prophet Mohamed, peace and blessings of God be upon him. May God guide them to the right path. Salam alikum. Don't forget that we are one Umma!
The messenger of God is a guiding light, he is one of the swords of God.
By God Who lifted the skies, my heart, my soul and all of me is longing to support my beloved prophet who is beloved by all the Umma. O government, forget about politics and chairs and take care of Jihad.
I want a Moroccan person who has sacrificed his life for the freedom of the nation.
Always Casa-crew as they're great and nice, their songs are great always Casa-crew
These are all lies! There are no facilities or anything else! How do they call it affordable housing while the developing company claims 5 millions under the table. If I had 5 millions, I would like to pay it legally in the file not to offer it to those with big bellies! This is inacceptable! O creatures of God, rental and living costs are killing us! I say it again there are no affordable houses in Morocco not in Doha, Al Omrane, Saada or Chaabi. They are all robbers!
I love so much the group Fnaire and H-kayne, I hope that you'll show interest for the rap style as it's very very good, for me I find tranquility in the rap style and I also like Bigg
Samira is one of the best singers. I wish you success in your artistic field. I like your songs so much. Thank you.
Your songs are very nice
I like you Ghani, you're really great!
This is very nice because I am one of the people who prefer the internet to look for new friends. I add that this is my favourite site and it is very nice. I thank so much everyone who work on it!
Abdelaziz doesn't deserve it. Basma is the star of the academy not him.
Hi Farid, we wish you success
Salam I liked the program and I liked so much the songs of the prime and evaluation, please, please send me your nice songs because I can't find them please, Mrs Khadija I love you
Smoking is good.
Hi Rabie! I am Fadwa. Did you recognise me? I like you so much! You're great! I am crazy for you! I like all your movies.
Salam. I am 27. I am a partner in a business for installing metal electricity poles. I am about to enter a big project for which I will need big sums of money. I need someone to help me in order to benefit from Moukawalati programme. I think this programme can solve the problem. Finally, I wish from God success to everyone.
There are no more studies, just making fun and playing around even the teachers are just receiving the salary for nothing and they worsen things with strikes and there are more holidays than study days. Oh Lord this is enormous. The educational level is deteriorating. This is getting worse in the Arab World. From here terrorist cells will emerge, and even high cost of living. Oh Arab rulers, wake up.
Salam. I am a young girl from the city of Oujda. I have a university degree in Islamic Studies. I would like to get a loan from Moukawalati to set up a small business.
Salam. May God rest the soul of the national team. I am one of the friends of the national coach Badoooooooooooooooooooou Zakiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii. I hope that officials will call back Bado Zaki. Zaki forever. Hajji and Zairi forever.
Long live Morocco. I address my greetings to my mother, my father, my aunts as well and to my grandmother. My brothers, the Moroccan national team needs a women association if we want to make progress brothers. Peace, mercy and blessings of God be upon you. This is for the free Moroccans from your brother Adil Almelod. For Aya and Hadi.
We want Zaki alone, he is the hope. We want Zaki he is.
We want Zaki and nothing else.
Long live Zaki.
Bado Zaki forever. Long live Bado Zaki. Why is the Moroccan federation against the will of Moroccan fans who deserve all the good? Hello, listen to me please...one thing...Dialog is the best way to solve all conflicts... Long live Zaki the former player of Mallorca. Long live Zaki.
I am Tarik from Oulmes. I love Morocco because I am Moroccan. I am proud of Morocco. There just have to be some efforts and God willing Morocco will be the best squad in Africa.
I prefer the return of Bado Zaki to the national team because he has experience and respect of players. I wish success to Morocco.
Co-existence of Muslims with Jews.
Salam Rabie. How are you? Well done! I like your films so much. God willing, we will see you in new films, God willing! I am from Kénitra. I am 25. I live in Spain. I wanted to be acquainted with you if you like. May God grant you success in the artistic field, God willing! Take care! I won't be long. How is Taza, good? Is it hot or cold?
May God rest the soul of our national team. It has become shameful in the face of other teams for which we had no consideration before. But now they defeat is. Where? On our pitch. Shame on you Muslims to laugh at Moroccans. Zaki should return to the national team whether you like it or not.
I am Wasim from the city of Al Hoceima. I am a fan of the national team. I still cannot understand why decisions makers in the federation still don't understand that the coach of the national team should be a son of the country concerned about his nation for whom they should prepare propitious ground and suitable conditions to work. This is a shame. What is wrong with the national team?
God bless Rabie son of Taza, son of my town. Pride to you! You are always illuminating us and honouring us. I wish you success. I am too the son of Taza. I always watch you. I like you so much because you are illuminating the city with your presence, by God!
I am Aziza from Taza. I am crazy for Rabie Kati! He is a great actor!
Here, sons of Guelmim are lost. We have no football institution. We have talents in all sport activities. We hope that officials will consider us. The situation is disastrous.
Hi, your brother Ibrahim from Rabat. It is known that we Arabs, and more than that we Maghreb people are brothers, but why do we allow problems to separate us since we share many things, historical and traditional? I want to say hi uncle Abd Smad in dear Tunis and a greeting to Salma+Sohayl+Abdollah Siham, a kiss to all of you.
Hi everyone. My name is Samira from Tangier, Morocco. I'm 14, I want to say that I love you Khairi. I love him to death and I like all candidates of the Maghreb star academy 1 but namely Khairi ok a kiss. I hope to see you in Morocco. I want your phone number tomorrow. Bye Khairi.
I congratulate Hajar for her victory and wish her a happy life from Tangier.
Hi Khairi I want to get to know you better.
Please, I would like to know one thing. Why hasn't anyone of you considered that what is happening among us is in the interest of America, European countries and Jewish occupiers? Who is the real terrorist? Is it us or America which is killing innocents, children and old people? Why don't we call it terrorist? It has found you Arabs ignorant and it has done what it wants and sowed sedition between you all. Everyone must know that the goal of America is to eliminate the religion of Islam. The real religion is the one it has called terrorism. Think twice before it is too late. America has appointed itself as a God other than Allah. It wants us to worship it. When it sees people worshiping God sincerely, it calls them terrorists and accuses them of killing. It says that they kill innocent people. Do you know why it says innocents? Because these are traitors who betray their country, religion and people. These are the innocents! They get positions and power. They don't care about their honour, their daughters or even their nations. They bring foreigners to rape their daughters. As for those who are concerned about their honour and their religion, you call them terrorists. Who will defend the religion, nation, women, children and old men? Those you call terrorists have pride but you have no pride because you want mundane life and it has swallowed you. May God guide you! Now you consider that the one who worships God, performs dawn prayer, fasts on Mondays and Thursdays and doesn't commit adultery is complicated. He is doing nothing from his own mind. He is carrying out the orders of God. If he adds anything from himself, he will be held accountable for it. To sum it up, you don't like the law of God. You should know that you are not fighting the ones you call terrorists, you are fighting God. It is God Who is the most powerful. You know the truth. May God guide you and guide us. Personally, I know that I am drowned in sins but I ask God to forgive me. However, I don't mock Muslims.
O Lord support Islam although disbelievers dislike it, die in your wrath!
Congratulations Antar, I wish you a happy life with your wife! I die for you! A kiss, Marwa from Annaba, I am 13.
I am a Moroccan citizen. I love all Arab countries. However, there are unexpected events in Libya. For example, why are foreign countries intervening while Arab countries are in deep sleep when foreign countries intervened? However, there is a reason behind this. Even if Kadhafi leaves, alliance countries won't leave. May God help us!
Sons of Guelmim are very lost!
I want to see the Algerian film "Lahn Al Amal" by Abderahmane Jalte and dubbed serials.
Salam alikum. This year I am in the baccalaureate and I expect to sit for the second session. May God grant success to everyone, oh Lord.
I don't think that the baccalaureate still has any value. Honestly, one wants the baccalaureate because some who are weak in studies have received it.
Salam. Honestly, there should be no frustration. Success is in our hands with some work, patience and study, we will pass. We should not assign everything to the government. Success or failure is in our hands. I wish success to everyone.
If she has died may God have mercy on her and bless her
I am Ayoub. I study in the sixth year. I would like to tell you may God grant you success brothers. Intensify your prayers and salam. God doesn't forget His subjects. May God grant you success.
I prefer that Morocco offers jobs to active young people.
This is very good and interesting for African young people.
Greetings- go, they know you.
We hope Mohamed VI will expel them, God willing!
Long live, long live terrorism my friends. I was very poor. But with the Islamic group of the Arab Maghreb I have a lot of money. Anyway, I have a good life now.
This terrorism is no way associated with our religion, which calls for tolerance, fraternity and cohabitation between civilisations. It is known that a companion came to the prophet, peace and prayer upon him, and told him 'oh messenger of God, raging dogs are attacking us, let's exterminate them'; the messenger of God replied 'no, dogs are one of God's nations; He created them on earth'. There is much evidence that this religion is a religion of tolerance and not a religion of blood and barbarism as the enemies of God pretend in America and Europe.
Hi. I hope this hardship will be overcome.
I thank you for this help. I hope you will always be like this!
Thank you very much for these topics because they tackle everything I was looking for!
Thank you very much for this useful information! I thank you very much for this nice and great site. I hope to see more of this interesting information.
Salam alikum. I am Soukaina. I want an article about World War II. I hope my request will be met, ok. Thank you!
I would like to thank you for this.
Salam. I haven't understood anything about what you wrote. I want a lesson that covers all contributions of Morocco in World War II. Thank you very much!
Salam. I want an essay about the colonisation of Morocco by France.
Salam alikum everyone. You too friends, I want some article about the contribution of Morocco in World War II.
Peace of God be upon you. I wanted to know whether the signature of the wife was eliminated.
Shame on you, you killed Kadhafi! Now America will control you as it wants, o donkeys of Libya!
Hi! I am Mansour Habib, Algerian. May God rest the soul of Moamer Kadhafi in paradise and humiliate NATO and the corrupt, o Lord o merciful, amen my Lord amen!
Peace of God be upon you. I'm a young man. I am 25. I'm married and have a young child. But I'm not allowed to lay eyes on him. But I don't know the solution to my story.
My dear brothers and sisters. I am an immigrant in Europe. My wife wants to divorce after I did so much for her so that she could join me. But when she grew up, she wants total freedom. My question is the following, is there anything new or a change in the family code? Please inform me. I heard that changes were introduced to the family code. I am waiting for your reply. Thank you.
Salam alikum and thank you for helping us. I'm a young girl, 26, and I got married a year ago. My husband lives in Spain. For six months now, his attitude towards me has been different. We don't have children. He comes to Morocco but doesn't come to see me. Now I want a divorce. What can you tell me about this? Do I have any rights?
Corrupt women are forbidden from taking any right from a man in a divorce. You must fight corrupt women, not encourage them. Man is poor, he is the victim in this farce. You must consider his financial condition if he wants to marry again, not destroy him.
Salam alikum. I want to know the Family Law, especially if I divorce from my husband. I have one daughter with him; she's 7.
Is there any rise, or are these just lies about wages?
Enough ridicule on Algerian TV!
I'm tired of life, I'm a girl and I will also join a terrorist cell inchallah as soon as possible.
Who's that, what's going on, but of course long live Mouloudia to death.
The Mouloudia of Algiers relieved the country like Anka Hamoud Boualam.
This is unacceptable but in the world it will have greater power. O Lord the greatest and praise be to God!
bravo
We are the Umma of Mohamed. Anyone who offends our religion is our enemy. Our love for our messenger is bigger than our love for our souls. Peace and blessings of God be upon dear Mohamed. There is no other God but God, Mohamed is the messenger of God. I am a Moroccan girl and I am proud of my homeland and religion Islam.
May God guide us and guide you, may God grant us health and wellness.
Nasro and Bilal forever. They are the stars of rai.
Praise be to God.
God is sufficient for us and He is the best disposer of affairs. The messenger of God is the best creature. Our noble messenger is above the sky. The barks of dogs won't reach him!
There is no power and no will but from God.
Salam alikum. I think that it is better not to watch this film.
Islam is our religion and this is the most important thing. There is no other god but God, Mohammed is the messenger of God.
Congratulaaaaations to the Libyan people! I congratulate you from all my heart. Praise be to God, the prayer of the oppressed is not rejected!
Moamer Kadhafi 100%.
Hello! Happy Ramadan
This is a good site! Two thumbs up!
Hi all friends who encourage Fnair and I want to say that all Moroccans love Fnair.
Hi Fnair…You know, I adore you. But for you Mohsin, not because I love you, you're my only baby I love you son of my country…and for the kid who said that Fnaire has nothing to do with rap, he is below level, it is him who has nothing to do with life he should die that mad dirty Casawi. I also want your cellular number and your msn baby (Mohsin) I really love you.
I thank this group.
Pride to Bahjawa!! !! I like you fnair are you the best 4ever.
Fnaire forever.
Hi. I'm new to this site and hope to be your friend. Certainly Fnaire is the best group we have in Morocco. I wish them a successful career and more success. I'm crazy for them namely Mohsin the handsome.
I want the paper of the statement.
Is it possible to check Social Security?
Because of a closed mail account, is it possible to register another bank account?
Who is my favourite singer
Salam. I would like to be affiliated with the Social Security Fund. I sell food stuff. What should I do?
I would like to know how to make sure that I am registered with Social Security.
I would like to inquire about the number of points I have.
Hi Basma. You deserve the title of the star for this season 2009.
I am Zouhir from the town of Zaio. I want information about vocational training.
I have a problem. I have been married just in Al Fatiha marriage for two years now. Today I have a child, she is six. The man I am married to went in the 6th month to Morocco and married another wife. Now I don't know what to do. I ask for help because I face a serious problem.
The family code and women's rights caused great failure and little ambitions for building a family. Now young men are threatened and scared of marriage which was legitimised by God and allowed us to marry 4 women. But what do we see? The rate of marriage has dropped and the rate of divorce has increased in Moroccan courts. All young men avoid marriage. They are scared. They don't have hope in their life.
I hail from Tangier. I want to play football with the academy. I am 17, I play with Ajax Tangier.
Hajar is from a good family, and she deserves the title. But Hamid even more, he also deserves it by God. Anyway, congratulations to Hajar, I'm from Tangier and originally from Casablanca and love them both and wish them success.
I am proud to be Lebanese!
Lebanon is my soul.
I love Lebanon and live in Morocco. I hope to visit Lebanon.
Long live hassan nssre lahhe- I love Lebanon, I love you, Lebanon.
My friend Bigg how are you, may God help you. Take care of me. I am Abd Razak. Bye, bye.
What improvement are you talking about? The revenue of the student doesn't allow him even to have a decent dinner, so what about other things?
Salam. Incomplete information, better change to something better.
I am Radoiane from Morocco. I love Algeria because it is my country of origin. I love the sons of Saadane. I hope we will take the World Cup. May God assist us and win! If a team has Cristiano or Messi, we have men!
Hi, I liked this program
By God my brothers, this is a shame. "He hit me and cried, he raced me to complain." All this is caused by hallucination pills. It is the biggest danger. You have oil. You forgot faith. You forgot neighbourhood and Islam. May God guide you! We don't need anything with or without you.
A Maghreb site which covers very good topics. I wish it continuity.
These news are strange to the city of Boulemane.
Me I like
I wish you more success :)
I thank the Red Crescent association for its great efforts to improve the situation of the citizens. A volunteer in the Moroccan red crescent, branch of Tangier.
Hi I'm Yassin how are you? Are you ok? I want some information about these first aid measures if you don't mind ok.
Don't forget that Arabs agreed not to agree.
Salam alikum. You are right about this. We, all the people of Bejaia, support you.
I would like to see this happening.
This is a nice presentation. I liked it so much. It has helped me. May God reward you with good my sister.
To the sweetest Bassoma, we love you so much even if you didn't take it, you're a star. Your voice is fascinating.
I love my country so much, Bahara Ramla, Ljamaa, Bahraa beach.
A greeting to Bahri family, my cousin.

Long live Bahara beach. How are you Chmit with sons of Bajawi?
You told us you will bring immigrants in Italy to Libya. Where are they?
Long live Bahara beach. Long live our country Algeria. This is from Hafid and all the people of Bahara. Eh, illegal immigrants we miss you so much. Pray with us, God willing, hhhh, to beat Egypt and go to the World Cup. I love you and would die for you. OK, again, let's not forget the family of Med Seghir.
I want you please to help me. I am looking for plastic surgery centres in Casablanca. Please provide me with some addresses. Thank you!
Salam alikum. I have the scar of burning in my hand. I need the address and phone number of a good doctor in plastic surgery. Looking forward to a reply!
I am not happy with the size of my nose. I want to make it smaller. Can you guide me to a cosmetic surgeon? Thank you!
This is serious.
Salam alikoum. Has this sheikh ever fixed something denied by religion, has he ever implemented the religious law, only then can he speak. This man is under the control of the oppressive and hypocritical Moroccan government…
God, the nation and king.
My brother Bilal, you betrayed me and I forgive you because I haven't written to you. I wrote to all the people. Your agent is a traitor. You don't know that he swindled some songs. Everyone should know that "Amin", "Tokyro", "Sohayla", "Kiwahran Kima Casa" are mine. May God forgive you, you don't know this.
Salam, I live so much Bilal. I die for Bilal. Pride and victory to Bilal.
I love you so much, bless you Cheb Bilal.
Hi, How are you? I love so much the songs of Bilal. May God protect him. Bilal is the king of Rai without rival.
Long live Bilal. May God protect you. As you said, God is great. Don't mind the words of the jealous. You are always great. I liked you so much in your song "Yamma" (mother), may God protect her for you, amen. When you were in Agadir festival, you sang, you felt me, God was great.
I am Hasna from Morocco. I love Bilal so much. Honestly, he is the king of rai. Those who talk about him talk in vain. I hope he will always be great, great.
I also want to undergo a surgery to my nose and I have a white scar on my hand as a result of burnings when I was young. Is here an aesthetic surgery in Tetouan in a particular hospital and highly experienced doctor whom one can trust?
Smoking.
Thank you.
There are no terrorists in Morocco. You are the terrorists who are unjust to people. How much do you get for this? You are associated with the Jews and have agreed against your Muslim brothers. May God sanction you. No, Morocco will never make progress.
We are always for Morocco, for Hajar in Star Academie, with Haji and Zaki, we are always for Morocco, Morocco forever, Morocco, Morocco, Morocco and for Olympic Safi although I am the daughter of Safi. Morocco is always winning even against foreigners. The beautiful is respectable for his beauty and the ugly only if God guides him. I am always for Safi, and you are always great. We hate the capital and love the king. Eh enemies, don't separate us hhhhh. Olympic of Safi forever, Safi forever, they will win, no matter what you say.
This is too much for Morocco, it will always remain Morocco.
Honestly, I think these words and this strategy soothe the heart. However, words are words and acts are acts. Between the first and second there is just the distance of a signature and effort matching these words. My question is very simple: Is an offer of help possible? I'm an artisan from the city of Chefchaouen. I have many diplomas including a university degree from Abdelmalek Saadi University in Tetouan. I am waiting for a reply via the site. Thank you!
I'm a runner in the 1500m, and I hold a record of 3:58. I love Hicham El Guerrouj
Deraza is a nice craft. Decision-makers take care of it responsibly. Thank you! As for handicrafts, there are just lies at the fairs.
Bla, Bla, Bla, we are Amazigh people whether you like it or not. A greeting to every free Amazigh. I love you Tamazight! We found interest in our cause in Europe and we didn't find it from our Arab brothers.
I'm Hassan I love you Saida.
I'm with the fixed phone
You're so nice
I am Algerian. This country suffers so much from terrorism. But today, praise be to God, thanks to men, Algeria has triumphed. But those who speak in the name of religion are hypocrites and agents. They work for countries who don't like Algeria. Salam alaikum.
Salam alikum. I am looking for an e-learning course of a master in a Moroccan university. I have a nice experience with e-learning as I have received a diploma from Germany but I need a master please help me.
Hi, it is a good thing that we find a website like this.
How is it possible from the net to the mobile phone? Thank you.
I am Lamia. I study at a school in Sidi Bernoussi. I like Maroc Telecom but when I talk to Jamal or Hocine from public phones Maroc Telecom, they steal my purse I don't know why.
I want to know why Morocco isn't like other countries- it has resources but its rulers weren't even good.
I never knew anything about politics. I want to say that we all in Sousse support our president Ben Ali because most of us live better than many countries. I hope unemployment will be eliminated in Tunisia. Young people of Sousse are with you best president. I am a loyal citizen who loves his country.
You have to be grateful to God for the safety of your country! Long live Zine Al Abidine Ben Ali!
I'm dying to live in Morocco!
I like [those enrolled in] technical education because they study hard.
I don't receive Social Security benefits even though I am married. What should I do?
Salam. This is a very good site. I hope you will answer the suggestions. I study in the third year of lower secondary school. I don't know what to choose: mathematical sciences, experimental sciences or economics. I am good in maths and physics. I hope you will reply. Thank you. May God reward you with good.
I'm Meryam from Casa, Morocco, I love Khayri so so much.
Salam alikum. Everything we hear about this hideous act, it is a terrible mistake. However, accusing each other and say Salafis want to impose their stigmas on us, in my opinion, all this is not reasonable. As to the issue of freedoms, everyone is free in himself. However, feelings of others should be respected. But if Morocco were a Muslim country, sharia should be instituted. I don't think Morocco is an Islamic or secular country. Anyone who says that freedom means that a woman goes out on the street as she wants, this is wrong. Anyone who says this is wrong, is deprived and it is all in his eyes.
Thank you Nessma TV for the TV program. I like Hamid like crazy. By God the Almighty. Bye.
This is unacceptable. Why do we go back to the Stone Age? Islam has settled this a long time ago.
Hi. how are you? I want to make the badge of the film.
God is the greatest!
Congratulations Libya!
I am an assistant pharmacist. My monthly salary is 3000 Dirhams a month. I have work papers. I need help to buy a flat. What should I do?
An advice, stay away from loans, they are hard to deal with. At the beginning they are good but then come the problems and banks deduct more than the agreed installments.
Salam. I want to buy a house where I can live in Agadir. What should I do? Thank you!
I support you our hero Gourzane Anas!
Hello, Haifa. You're silly just like your name means.
Salam alikum. Praise be to God for the Islamic Bank. May God reward you with all the good!
I would like to get an apartment from the social housing program without interests immediately. Is there really any Islamic bank in Morocco? I hope that the prime minister Mr Benkirane really sets up this bank in Morocco because we need it and so that our conscience would be in peace in front of God concerning usury.
Haifa Wehbe is very attractive and the best singer for me! I love here very much and wish her success. Thanks.
I love Basma so much, both her voice, beauty, values and attitudes. I like her all even if she has not taken the title of the star academy 6. However, in the eyes of all the Arab world except Saudi Arabia, she is the star of the Academy 6. As she has honoured all Moroccans, may God honour her.
I'm a young man, my name is Hicham, I'm from Morocco. I have participated in many programmes, I sing very nicely but was thwarted in the super star. I participated about two months ago, but they ruined me, I sing the Jabli very nice, even the photographers and presenter of the programme Wael Mansor liked my voice. I hoped to sing in front a jury who has a good knowledge of music, but they brought a jury which has nothing to do with music. This is a big mistake in which the super star has fallen because there are voices by God that are better than me and deserve to go to Lebanon, but we're powerless. You will see me in future, my name is Hicham. Give your sincere opinions about me! I will participate until I succeed and inchallah you'll see me very soon. Thank you. Hicham Mrabet 'Morocco'
Bravo Moroccans, but shame on you Abdelhamid, you should have voted for Kawtar, Bravo Hajar, but you Farah you should be proud of being Moroccan, what's the matter with you? Simo from Fkih Ben Salah, Morocco
Hi, how are you, I love you so much, I offer this message to the Maghreb star my greetings to Hajar, Farid, Yosra and Ahmed today you're the stars
You will always be opposing the brothers instead of standing in one rank. But you are obstructing them. Why don't we stand in one rank against Zionists? (This is because Arab rulers like to take flour and rob money of the people).
I'm a scout leader in Morocco. I suggest to our scout friends in the Arab world to send us books about new things in scouting in Arab countries and the world, and training sessions. Salam alaikoum.
O strike oppressors with oppressors and take us out among them safe.
I wished to work in this commercial center. I have a diploma in word processing. I wish to work. Help me! I work in Casa.
Praise be to God for His blessings!
Salam. Which state? Or the state is the story of Libya. Libya will always remain Libya. But what is the issue here? What is the fabricated scenario? Are allies really concerned about the Libyan people or are they concerned about Libya only as geography and the largest oil reserves in the world? Maybe yes and how? Moreover, the problem has a name. It is Kadhafi. The solution of the problem therefore is the departure of Kadhafi. But I say as principle, I am Mustapha from Morocco, Kadhafi cannot leave Libya regardless of what it will cost him even if he has to burn all Libya, he won't leave at all because he knows the size of the conspiracy which is studied strategically against Libya. As for those traitors who were paid by America and its allies, they are agents, leaders of transitional council in Libya which has lost all credibility. To sum up, a conspiracy was hatched with the texture of Arab hands. Unfortunately, Qatar has signed about one thousand documents with the west in general under the table so that it could host the world cup 2022. Logically, when has Qatar joined FIFA to have legitimacy to host this big event? Aren't we entitled to ask this? However, it is certain that Libya is a name which has a meaning such as Kadhafi, leader, king of kings of Africa whether you like it or not. Moreover, Libya will be the last place for the defeat of America and its allies.
I want a composition about clandestine immigration. Please.
Peace, mercy and blessings of God be upon you. We hope from the bottom of our hearts that Moukawalati helps all Moroccans by publishing or writing some small projects or all small projects so that it would help individuals to choose a project. We hope you will provide us details about these projects or even some projects. Thank you very much for your contribution in helping our dear Morocco!
I am Kada Hamaoui. I am looking for a job in agriculture.
I'm Ayoub. I'm 22. I want to go to Italy because there's a lot of money.
Hi, I'm Siham from Morocco. Don't immigrate, your country needs you. You kill yourselves for nothing instead of that 1000000 or 2000000 set up a project. You're just wasting away yourselves. See you soon.
Don't lose your souls for the souls of others.
No to immigration! Your country is better.
Bravo!
May God rest the soul of Kadhafi, I am witness and thankful!
Libyans are animals! Anyone who kills his president is an animal. No matter what happens, he is the president of state.
It is not good that you do this film. This is because the person who produced it is not religious, is an infidel. I address a call to everyone who has watched this film and tell him you are an infidel or Shia, you have no shame. May God take you to hell, you who produced the film, you who acted in the film and you who are watching it, o American infidels who are irreligious and Shia!
Bravo for ! Very well done! A blessing for me a "foreigner" who appreciates the English so well translated plus your ARABIC translation is a great way for me to learn classical Arabic God willing! The Darijah dubbing on TV also helps me to be able to understand the language of the "homeland"  how to speak it although my poor Egyptian gets me by but I prefer to speak the language of the heart! I love Morocco and since I have the blood of the farmers from my late USA father  my dear rural mother of 6 children, God bless them, she is still alive, praise be to God! Thank you! Al-3aerobie from the homeland in America- State of Alabama! Goodbye! Peace, mercy and blessings of God be upon you! Bye bye! Please write me an email, just look below please!
Haifa you're a real jewel and every girl wants to be like you, and if she can't, she just says that you're ugly. But I love you so much.
I would like to play with Barcelona team.

I want help to set up my project of growing rabbits.
It is our pleasure to express my attachment to this magazine for it is always and undoubtedly the most beautiful.
Salam. I want to set up a project of a farm in the south of Morocco on an agricultural land of 8 hectares. I want a loan. Thank you!
Peace and mercy of God be upon you. I am a Moroccan man and I live in Saudi Arabia. I want a reply to my question if possible. Why don't we have loans without interest? Thank you!
Salam alikum. I am Moroccan young girl. I am 34. I have a diploma in traditional and modern dressmaking. I have experience in the manufacture of ready-made dresses as I have worked in a textile factory for seven years. I have tried to set up my own business but can't find the best way. I ask Mukawalati to help me set up my business I am in the process of studying. It is a school for teaching dressmaking and manufacture a marketable product. This will contribute to the progress of industry and boost the economy of our country God willing! You have all consideration. May God grant success!
I love you, Karim Ziani. I love you so much. You're my life and soul. I love you so much!
Salam alikum. I am Ahmed from Morocco. I am 20. I want your help to find a solution. I have a capital to set up a project. However the problem is what kind of project. I don't have experience. Please help me!
Salam alikum. I need an explanation of small loans. Thank you!
I want to set up a project. I am Moroccan.
In the name of God the most gracious the most merciful. Morocco is a great country. Unfortunately, there are robbers in the police especially in Bab Sebta.
I'm Mouad, I love Hajar and vote for her because she's beautiful and nice, I ask God to grant her success and to all Morocco and Moroccans in the star academy.
The program of Nessma is a very nice program and the girls in the star we love you so much
I just want to tell you if you want to commemorate something, you should be keen not to hurt the feelings of people, ok?
Always the FAR, it's not only the boys who love the FAR even girls are fond of the FAR, long live the FAR.
Despite the victory of the WAC over the FAR we'll remain with the FAR till death
always always FAR
Always military to the tomb God willing the Military League
My name is Hamid from Morocco. I am a dressmaker in Algiers. I am writing this message to people who deal with craftsmen. You should take care of them as they are very prone to fall victims of fraud and cheating. Thank you
I wish I could learn the Moroccan Caftan. I wish I could design the Moroccan Caftan and sew something like this. I like so much the Moroccan Caftan and Djellaba.
I am a fan of authentic Moroccan Caftan. I like it so much. This is why I joined a school to learn. Thank God, I learned. I would like to advise sisters to learn, especially Moroccan Caftan, Djellaba and Takchita.
God is the greatest! Islam is the purest religion. The messenger is the purest human. God is above all! He waits but doesn't neglect.
Give us money and we will build you a mosque under the sea.
I am from Algeria and my uncles are Moroccan. I love Morocco and will die for it.
There is no other God but God. God suffices me and He is the best mandate. May God take revenge on the outrageous disbelievers!
To me you're all winners, I wish you good luck.
Hajar is the best one- why is she no longer making songs? Hajaaaaaar
Long live Morocco!
God bless you all, I love you Farah your voice is great, I would like to meet you when you come to Morocco
these returns are too much, that's not real, everything is fabricated
I'm Nihad from Morocco, I say to Hajar good luck you're the star inchallah, long live Hajar I love you
May God rest his soul!
The girls' camp wasn't great without boys.
These teachers who should be concerned about the country, they aren't fit for teaching. They don't care if the nation is spoilt. Let them make it a blank year, without studies.
Welcome Adel Imam. I love you very much. My name is Karim, 15, I love you and want to become an actor like you. I live in Sweden but my Arabic is great. I love you very much!
Thank you for this programme. Good luck!
I am a Raja fan to death. I ask God they win the league. Raja forever to death.
Hi. I am Manal from Oujda. I love Raja Casablanca so much, and hope from my heart that it wins. It really deserves success. I tell them well done.
Salam. I am Amal from Agadir. I am 15. Honestly, this new style of the Moroccan young people today is a great style. A pure Moroccan hip hop. Honestly, as we see, Fnaire are trying to establish the Moroccan traditional rap. They have sincerely succeeded. I won't thank just Fnaire. There are many groups in Morocco but it is production which is missing. I ask God to grant success to all the groups who have the same dreams. The Moroccan people are longing for music. Ok, thank you. I wish success to everyone.
Bigg the loser show some respect you have gathered (unclear) and left the values destroyed.
Congratulations to us!
I am Hamid the singer (bow wow mix). I love H-kayne more than Bigg, why? Because Bigg says many bad words and H-kayne is very clean without any indecencies. Fnaire forever, Bigg is the loser. He has a broken chord. Hahaha. I am Hamid. Bye. Thank you.
I am Mohamed El Farissi. I want to play with the national team but discrimination has ruined us. I prefer Zaki and the defender Benatiya.
Nothing. The Moroccan sport federation is a mafia - robbers. They are mocking the people... too much.
I'm Moroccan and I love Algeria so much. I hope from God that these two countries will be reconciled.
I love Bado Zaki, Monir Al Hamdaoui, Chamakh, Adil, Taarabt, Haji.
Oh Zaki!
We bring back Bado Zaki. Long live Bado Zaki. The national team has obliterated the history of a team built by men. Now they have brought arrogant players who have a lot of money, they have no enthusiasm of football or for their country. We want players who will lift the flag not frustrate it. Therefore, we ask officials to bring back Zaki. He knows how to select players who have enthusiasm.
I hope Bado Zaki returns to the national team God willing.
Salam. Dancers of Morocco, you're no longer lions. You have become filthy goats. We want Bado Zaki. Fassi Fihri should stay away from football. Politics have nothing to do with football. From the day you sold the game to Tunisia, you were beaten by the curse of Moroccans, meaning its people. Stop trickery and robbery.
Badou Zaki.
I like you so much because you are the best Moroccan actor! I hope to see you.
I would like to join the Algerian national team.
My name is Omar from the town of Sefrou. I like so much Rabie. Honestly, he is a distinguished actor. He is one of the best young actors, if not the best one. I wish him success in his career.
I love you so much Rabie El Kati!!
Salam, Osama. May God assist you Rabie, God willing. May God assist al-Qaeda.
I will defend the nation.
Hi I hope that the friendship between Ahmed, Hajar, Soraya and Hamid will progress into love as they fit each other, if possible the msn of the 14 candidates please.
Hi everyone. At the beginning, I would like to thank all candidates for this effort. What I want you to do is add a beauty and fashion page, some similar topics for girls, ok, thank you.
I love you so so so much.
I'm Aziz from Taza I'm very proud of you Hajar and Hamid.
I'm Imane from Casa exactly from Sbata I love Hajar the rose of Casa, my Mum loves Ahmed and Abdelhamid, my sister loves Soraya and Farid, my friend loves Yousra and I love Badrou so much and when he left I wept by God and I think that Hajar is the star, I vote for you by God.
Hi, I love all candidates you all deserve to be stars, I like Badrou Badrou I love madly his voice, and I love him so much, by God, I vote and my Mum voted for Ahmed and Hajar the rose of Morocco, a kiss.
Hi Bassma. You're the nicest star in my eyes. Don't care about the title. You're the best title in the eyes of all Moroccans especially Casa residents.
Good, may God help you in the coming actions!
Algeria manufactures Zalabiya, that's all.
Praise be to God for everything.
Why do you offer a second session and you know how many will pass? Why are you unfair to literature students? This is too much. We have studied all the programme. What do you want more? We did all our efforts, but why all this, why?
Hi. I am one of the students who succeeded in the baccalaureate literature exam. I want to say to some of my colleagues who say that they studied hard but failed, studying hard isn't enough. The important thing is that you must understand as well the moral condition with which you enter on the day of the exam. I haven't learnt the lessons by heart but during the last ten days I understood the lessons and passed. I was sure that I won't pass. But, praise be to God, I passed in the first session. Many students with me failed because they learnt the lessons by heart without understanding them. I wish success to those who will sit for the baccalaureate next year. I tell them don't rely on the idea that you studied but failed. Review your courses and understand your lessons. Take it from my experience.
This country has shed a lot of blood for two lines of ink. Even the fraudulent minister of education has misled us with conjugation. Before you read or understand, look where to work. We will never understand each other with the government even if we both speak Arabic.
By God brothers, we no longer understand nothing in this country. We know longer know Muslims from infidels. If anyone is a Muslim, he is a Muslim for himself. The infidel is infidel for himself. I love all the people from both sides. On the day of judgment, no one will recognize you neither Muslims nor infidels. Everyone will see his acts on the day of judgment. But now, people are fighting each other and we are just watching them. I say may God guide them all. We are all humans. If anyone does something, he does it for himself. The Muslim should pray, praise God, thank Him and behaves properly to people. In the past why were Muslims attacked? It is because Islam was new and people didn't understand it.
I like 'Hadj Lakdar' and 'Fighting hearts'.
I agree with these Maghreb comments. In the explanation of the Messenger, peace be upon him, he said by the end of his life: "I haven't seen anyone lacking in intellect and religion, taking the mind of the wise man like you (women)." They said, Messenger of God, what is the lack of her intellect, it is understood metaphorically, not literally. God the Almighty knows better. Copied. Your sister Amina, thank you very much! Salam.
I am a young girl who's been married for four years, and I have one child. My husband want us to divorce because of his parents. There is always trouble with them. I would like to see whether there is any good in him or not. Thank you!
I wish success to everyone and I encourage their skills.
God willing, we will succeed.
I hope that they'll not be hard on them because every athlete takes
Salam. I am Youssef from Youssoufia. I am from the club of OCY in weightlifting. I thank you for this site. I wish you continuity. Salam.
From Mostafi. Eighty percent of Moroccans don't know the value of the phone.
I am Abir from Annaba. I love Jamal so much!
Thank you very much for this help. May God assist you for what He likes and accepts.
Peace and mercy of God be upon you. Thank you very much for this honourable contribution. I hope from God to grant you success for the better. Thank you. I would like to know if Moroccans who survived the war and are still alive receive a salary? Please reply honestly. Thank you.
Hi! I want to know the problems of Morocco in World War II.
Salam. I want a topic about the World War.
I hope you will present a comprehensive lesson about government reforms.
I want a topic about World War I.
Thank you very much for this help. We hope from God that we will also help you. Thank you.
I want a completed file about the contribution of Morocco in World War II.
Salam alikum. I love a married man. Despite this he is ready to marry me. He proposed to my parents but I postponed the topic as we are concerned about his wife. We are worried about hurting her. Can we marry without her approval because we cannot build a family on the detriment of another family? Please I want a reply to my msn.
Khadija, I hope there will be something new very soon.
By God, it is a shame on the minister Ghellab. This is a shame and disgrace. It is a shame by God.
We hope to see another one better than this even if I like it but I want something new.
I am a Moroccan young man. I thought of setting up a business. But I don't know from where to begin. I ask for your help. Thank you!
Morocco to death! Wishes of success to the government, God willing!
Azul. We encourage the Amazigh channel. We have talents but we don't have necessary conditions to show them in the artistic and cultural field. But now, praise be to God. Azul.
I ask King Mohammed VI to seriously consider this project.
Azul my brothers and sisters. Bravo my sister, I have nothing to say. This has summed up everything and you have crowned it so that they will know that Amazigh people are always here.
Great, really great.
Many congratulations with many wishes for more good results God willing in your studies.
We are very happy for you. I wish you success. God bless you. You have honoured the country. May God preserve you always like this.
I am Mohamed from Morocco, the city of Salé, I am looking for a stable job in Spain. I have a diploma in mechanics.
Long live MCA, inchallah we'll take the Cup of Algeria this year as well the first cdb
In reality I can't find anything to say because I am myself looking for a job but amidst the unemployment phenomenon I discovered I don't think that I have an opportunity with you. But I won't despair. I am a young girl, I am 30, baccalaureate level, literature. I want to work to support my family thank you for your help. God is the assistant. May God assist you for the help you offer to young people.
I am a young Moroccan man, I am specialised in welding. I want to work in a company.
In my opinion, it is not possible to say something before I see everything with my eyes. One other word: thank you to all the staff working on this site.
My sister is 36. She had undergone a surgery to her breast about seven months ago. But she is still under treatment. I hope, God willing, that she recovers with the will of God. I wish recovery to all Moroccan Muslim women.
I feel a pain in my breast. I have done a diagnostic ultrasound at a public doctor. He told me that I have a hormone deficiency. But I still feel this pain. So what is it and what do you advise me to do? Thank you.
Salam. To whom it may concern. I am writing asking for help not for me but for my poor neighbour. She suffers from cancer. She needs to buy medicine to survive during her remaining days. You are aware about the costs of such medicines. She lives miserable conditions. Her situation is miserable. She moves around in a wheelchair. The disease is deteriorating day after day. So for those concerned, write me. Thank you very much.
Salam alikum. I am Sabrine from the eastern region exactly from the town of Bouarfa. My mother has had breast cancer since 24/10/2008. She is undergoing treatment in Oujda at an oncology clinic. They told her to undergo chemotherapy and radiation. I am concerned about losing my mother. If you know a better treatment or better doctor, please get in touch with me. Thank you. Bye.
Salam. I want to know symptoms of breast cancer. Thank you.
God is our mandate against you deceivers.
Nice articles, nice words, I hope it is true. I love you so much.
Please increase the salary, we are jobless and miserable, just consider us, may God rest your souls!
I want some information about vocational training for plumbers. This is because I have dropped out of school and now I work as a plumber. I am an expert in this job. Is it possible for me to study and get a degree in this? I wish success to everyone.
Jawad, I hope you will be well.
I hope that Jawad Zairi will be one of the players of the national team against Cameroon. I also hope Hamdaoui, Chamakh and Hajji will also be present. Have you forgotten what they did in the African cup organized in Tunisia? It was the pride of the entire world. I love the Moroccan national team.
Salam. Is it possible to have information about Jawad Zairi presently in 2009? In which game does he play now?
Good work.

I love you all, Fnaire =wwww Taza
I'm a fan of the singing group Fnaire and I encourage them so much and wish them success and prominence in their artistic career and even personal life.
I thank you Bouchra. In case anyone else shares my opinion, thank you.
Hi Fnair I love you so much, you have honoured us. We wish you more success.
Viva Kadhafi!
Fnaire is the best group in the world in terms of melodies and words.
I study in the first year of the baccalaureate in sciences. I am scared about the post-baccalaureate. I don't know what will happen or what to study. I would like to work in social affairs. Please advise us. What are available job opportunities in Morocco.
Terrorism.
Very nice, great!
You're valueless
Salam alaikoum too late.........???

Honestly, the novels of lady Ahlam are different from other novels. I haven't read before any novel like this last novel. Thank you and thanks to your novel. Salam.
O Lord rest the soul of Moamer Kadhafi in peace! He just died, he is not a martyr.
O Lord rest the soul of Moamer Kadhafi because he died not like a martyr. O Lord rest the souls of all presidents who died as martyrs!
Hi! My name is Lobna. I am very sad, very sad for Libya, its people and Moamer Kadhafi.
I like Star Academy lebanon. Are they going to make a Star Academy 2 of the Maghreb? Salma from Oujda.
This is a dog who shouldn't be buried in the cemeteries of Muslims.

Salam alikum. My name is Karima. I am 24. I am looking for a job. I live in the city of Tangier and I want to work for the Delphi company. Please help me if possible. Thank you.
We are Amazighs Imellalne and Iberkane.
Congratulations Antar and Leila! By God, Antar you took a good choice, a beautiful Kabylie girl!
Congratulations!
Moroccan Sahara not Western Sahara, fear God!
Salam. Bassma is the star. However, Saudis have more money. Bassma, Bassma, Bassma...
Thank you for allowing us to write. But I hate this programme. Don't you know this is blind imitation of other countries? This is certain and you recognize it with denial because Europeans took our ideas and we have taken their negative impacts. I don't say we don't care about art but we have taken it from its negative side. Why are there no programmes to spread Islam and corresponds to our religion or scientific programmes to face the world and spread the recommendations of our religion? Thank you.
May God help us.
A really great article. It is a honour for me to see a very intelligent girl so that God willing I can reach her level. There are still two years ahead. Even if I don't get them I know what to rely on and how I can achieve what I want. Of course she is an example. Oh Lord grant success to everyone in the baccalaureate please. Thank you. I am crazy for you, you're my soul and my life Bassma. I love you. You're the best one I saw in my life. The first one who will propose to you to be his fiancée is me.
No to terrorism, we must live in peace, that is all.
These are men not traitors. Islam is the solution, o traitors!
I am a girl who studies in the 5th year of the secondary. I study a scientific subject. In the third year of the secondary, I had 14.77 in the regional exam. Can this score help me study a technological subject?

Salam alikum. Apart from people that suffer from scars etc because of an accident, I think people need to see a shrink instead of a plastic surgeon. You are more than what people can see with their eyes. You have a brain and a personality. There are people that were born without hands or feet, or have never seen colours or anything at all... and you are whining about those 2mm that need to be removed from your nose? Thank God, He is the best Creator. Thank God for what you have. If you think you need to loose weight, eat less and move more there are so many ways. If you think your chest is too small think of the woman with no chest at all.. lost due to cancer.... think people think...
I am a fan of Moroccan rap especially Muslim. He is the best rapper in Morocco without rival. Muslim is the king of rap in Morocco.
I am a young Moroccan man. Forgive us people, young people don't just go to take drugs, there are reasons. When the young man goes to look for a job, he finds only the baccalaureate. You study until you are old and there is nothing. A young man sees that some are playing with money while one cannot even find what to eat. Isn't this madness. Find us a job and you will see different young people. This is the truth people. We hope that God grants us all an outlet.
Before blaming officials, we must blame ourselves. Who has encouraged officials to bring us drugs? Why don't we look for development methods instead of addiction? Some say that it is a way to forget. We must reform ourselves before blaming other people. If anyone of us reformed his interpretation, we would have made progress.
There is no evidence
Hi Bassma. I love you so much. When you will come out I will propose to you beauty. Waw because you're great. I was jealous of Yahya when he held you from your waist. I wished to be in his place. I always pray you love me only as half as I love you. I love you, beauty. The most beautiful Bassma in the world.
The attacks of Algeria are the fabrication of world intelligence services. As to this law, I encourage more developments. Congratulations to us for our media........
Salam. My name is Sobhi. About 40 people work with me in painting. However, I want to set up a business because this is helpful sometimes when accidents happen. A worker might fall from the ladder and have an injury. Who will face trouble then? It is me of course. If I have a business, give bills and assume responsibility for workers all year long and every month. I ask for your help, put hand in hand so that we can set up a business. I am now still in court with a man who used to work with me. I told him I will pay everything he spends. But his father wants more, but I don't have what to give. If I had a business, I would not have faced any responsibility. We have to stand and discuss this issue, ok.
Salam alikum. I am a young man, 28, from Tetouan. I have 14 years of experience in the traditional craft of wood carvings, Arab carpentry, ceilings and carving. I was manager of a big plant. But no luck! I want some ideas about Moukawalati so that I can set up my own company. This project will be successful God willing because handicraft has a special place and history. In Tetouan everyone knows my work in mosques and villas. How can I communicate with you? Thank you!
I am a young boy born in 1987. I am specialised in building electricity. I would like to set up a medium business. I need some initial information. I ask for your help. Thank you!
Hi, oh yes, the problem is that everyone has his own personality. Everyone likes to wear and eat what he likes, ok!
God is the greatest!
I am a Moroccan young man. I am willing to set up a project in raising poultry. My problem is that I don't have funds to carry out this project. I went to Banque Populaire but they rejected my application. Will all banks do the same?
I suffered burn scars on my hand when I was 11, as a result of melted plastic. I want to know the address of an aesthetic centre and also its fees.
My friend Bilal, is it true you are singing on us or against us? Just be yourself and walk on asphalt. I am concerned about you unless you fall from above and face the same fate as the fate of the late king Cheb Hasni. I apologise. Bye.
I want to have surgery to increase my breast size. I also want a face and neck lift. I am 25, I love plastic surgery. I want to know the cost of these surgeries. If any surgeon reads my letter, he can write to my email. Thank you.
I have a problem. My face is very slim. Are there hospitals in Marrakesh which inject the face with lipids? How much does this surgery cost? May God reward you.
Cheb Bilal, you're the best singer. I would like to meet. It is clear I like you so much.
Very good article but for every article we want answers, thank you.
Ben Laden is hero for this nation. What he did is not terrorism; it's Jihad God willing. So Moroccans stop lying to yourselves! America deserves what happened to it and more. We wish America, Russia and Israel sustain more suffering. Can't wait to hear such news happening!
May God protect you, Cheikh.
This is my second opportunity this year. We'll get it, God willing, oh Lord.
I love you Nancy. I wish you happiness in your life.
Thank you army!
It is nobody's business. Every girl is free to do whatever she likes. Go mind your own business! Moreover, wake up a little and let's be realistic!
Hi. I am Slim, 22. I would like to participate in the starac.
Al Garrouj is a world champion. After his retirement, Morocco will certainly find a replacement!
Salam alikoum my brothers. I am a student in the baccalaureate. I did well in the exam but I haven't passed. Therefore I am very sorry for that. But I see that those who the baccalaureate did nothing with it. So why should I be sad if our country is like this? All this unemployment. I hope that it will improve in the future. I ask God to grant success to the candidates who will sit for the second session.
Salam alaikoum. What I wanted to say about the baccalaureate exam is that there is a lot of cheating. Those who don't deserve to pass are those who pass. It is normal that if your father is influential or rich, you will secure the baccalaureate and even the best job. The choice is yours. Ok, may God reward everyone. Salam.
This is your nation, one nation
I congratulate the students who passed. May God grant patience to the students who failed, and success to those who will take the second session. May God bring good. With this low passing rate, I was scared by God. God is the protector. That is all.
Those who studied started a long time ago.
This is for the Sahara, I'm against opening the borders as they want to take the Sahara which is 100% Moroccan, anyone who touches my country I'll kill him.
I love you Nancy Yey Sihr Ouyounou
I liked these stadiums in Morocco. I would like to be one of the first viewers, ok yes it is possible.
Ines Deghidi, this is really messed up. Before you say Morocco and Tunisia, think well about pornographic movies you produce for families to watch them o mean Egyptians.
Salam alikum. By God, the acts of these people are shameless.
Salam. I hope you are well good Lord, hypocrites!
I still don't know what to do after the baccalaureate.
I am a second year baccalaureate student. I have an average of 16.50 in the regional exam and 15.11 in the class exam. However, I have a problem with the English language. I don't know what to do in order to speak it well. Please, if you know some solution, help me! Thank you!
I didn't have a good score in the regional exam. I had less than 10 and I am sitting for the baccalaureate second part. This year I have good scores in class exam but I repeat the regional exam. I study well for the national exam, but on the day of the exam I don't know what happens to me. Is my score in the regional exam the real problem?
I am Moroccan to the death!
Everyone is free about himself. This is because the day on which this young girl will be held accountable by God, she will be judged alone. These radical Salafis won't be judged with her. Therefore, they should be treated maybe they will be healed with time. God guides those who want.
God is the greatest!
Salam. Please bring back Bado Zaki because he is a very good coach and Moroccan, no Fakhir, no Fathi Jamal. We hope that Bado Zaki will do the same as Hassan Chahata.
I wish success to this site and that it will be the cause of success for many youths. I am a student in the third year of the secondary. I had a GPA of 16.25 in the first term. This is very honourable, but I'm confused about the choice of an adequate subject. Can you help me, please? I will be always grateful to you! Thank you!
Salam alikoum. I say to Hasna, it is necessary to have a 100% Moroccan coach so that we can achieve something. Just look at Bado Zaki and what he did, Fakhir who came for just two months, and gave a satisfactory result as to the performance of the players in the CAN 2006. But what have we gained from Michel? Nothing, now the important thing is that we all know that we need a Moroccan coach and look for talents in our league.
Kadhafi, go away!
Inacceptable!
I am very happy.
Many congratulations to all Libyans! I address all those who support Kadhafi with advice. I would like to tell them that Libya will remain high as long as the Libyan and Tunisian people are living, ok? The most important thing is that you might have taken money in order to support this tick. Advice to all those who put illegitimate money in their pockets, they should understand what they did because illegitimate money is not eternal and won't make them achieve anything. Finally, I hope all Arab countries will be liberated and live for the first time in peace. Many thanks and great respect to the opposite opinion.
I am a Moroccan citizen. I am 29. I am married and have two children. I am a street vendor. What are conditions for Fogarim loans to grant a loan to buy a suitable house? Thank you for your help! This is very nice of you! Thank you! Thank you!
Congratulations to the Libyan people!
I am a young married man. I rent a house with 100 dirhams. I would like to buy a house to settle down with my small family. My monthly income is 2300 dirhams. I wish to buy a house with 1100 dirhams a month enough to pay back? How can I live with 1200 dirhams? I hope officials will work harder so that all categories of society will benefit from it.
This policy is in the right place. Politicians must keep up their work seriously. Officials should assume their responsibility in the failure of this initiative. The only thing which is not accepted by the people is words without action. I encourage this policy. We are proud of it although we live abroad. Salam.
I'm Ahmed from Casa. I love Cheb Nasro, and hope to see him. By the way, I know all his songs.
In the name of God, in this current era, which is well-known, everything is possible and we will see more great things in this world and speed. But the most important thing is to preserve the purity of the body. Just look, contemplate and be patient because the era is led by Zionists until God the Almighty releases us.
We hope that the Moroccan state does something before they regret the day they have let corruption spread. This is very clear. We have the same goal. It is removing heads of Moroccan DST because they don't let us work freely.
Long live Hamid and Hajar, and let's not forget Farah and the one with the big smile Ahmed, I'm Badr from Oujda
God bless you, to God we are and to God we shall return, may God have mercy on your daughter Sabrina my brother Hakim.
In the name of God most gracious most merciful. A greeting to the dear readers, honestly, illegal immigration is a serious problem but it has many solutions: setting up business for young citizens, instituting important centres for vocational training, offering opportunities to the young people to enter the job market, avoid implementing the policy of eat and let others eat, reduce the high prices of goods which exceed the salary of the worker. Finally, please accept my respects. Salam alikoum. Your brother Fadk from the Southern regions in Ait Baamrane.
The colonel lived as a hero and died as a hero. Halima has returned to her old habits. It seems that Arabs are only good in treason. It is running in their veins innately. Tell me what history will record about you Arabs! For sure, you have offered Kadhafi more decorations.
Hamza from Algiers. May God rest your soul Moamer Kadhafi! May God protect us from you Libyans! You will be humiliated and will say if only Kadhafi were still here as we were living with him in grace!
Viva Arabs and all Muslims!
By God I'll not hide you Nas Ghiwan is the best group for me May God have mercy on my brother Batma and Haj Thami and I thank all the groups because they've taught us to live with the time
Salam alikum. My name is Zineb I live in London. I want to buy a house in Casablanca worth 40 millions. I want a loan from you. What are necessary papers. I want to know how much I have to pay. I want to know all details. Thank you!
I live in Spain and want a house in Morocco. I don't have work papers. How can I buy a house? Thank you!
Salam Hajar you're a star, I send you a kiss, Leila.
Always always the FAR
I bear witness that there is no other God but Allah. We Muslims must hold hand in hand and speak in one voice which is that of Mohamed, the messenger of God. We must hold on tightly to our religion because Mohamed, peace and blessings of God be upon him, fought for the word of Islam.
Mr Abdaljalal !! I cannot prevent you from saying what you think, but i could try to make you change your mind on various topics that you mentioned: 1- You wrote : "Democracy doesnt rhyme with Moroccan monarchy". I say that Moroccan monarchy rhymes with democracy 2- You wrote: "Western Sahara colonization", i answer there is no Western Sahara, just Sahara, which is Moroccan 3- You wrote: "Their deprivation of the most basic rights", fyi, i am 25, and when i was in Morocco, i enjoyed more and more rights!!!! Last, i am 99.99 percent sure that your words sound 100 percent Algerian. Salam !!!
Always FAR always BARCA
Always FAR - Morocco forever.
Without much talk and without long speech, all Morocco knows that H-Kayne has honoured their country, great they're really great.
Victory and pride to the FAR
Without much talk and without saying anything more, all Morocco knows that h-kayne have honoured their country, they're great, by God they're great. Bye, how are you.
Without much talk, all Morocco knows that H-Kayne have honoured us, they're really great.
The Moroccan Caftan is great. It is unique. It is known in the whole world.
Very nice! Since it is part of traditions up to now, I like it and I have decided to learn traditional design in Agadir. I hope the traditional dress will gain world fame. Thank you! We wish renewal in traditional dress because it is nice. Thank you! Greetings!
So odd this Caftan, there are better things. We want new things not the old ones, OK?!
There is nothing I like more than traditional dressmaking.
Salam alikum everyone! I ask you to provide me with a site for traditional dresses design. Thank you!
Salam. My name is Zahira. I am 17. I like Moroccan Kaftan and Moroccan Takchita. This is why I ask people for more sites.
Salam alikum. This is fascinating because it is part of the Moroccan heritage. You have to boost it!
Nice!
Hajar you're the star 2007 inchallah, Naima from Aghbala.
Bravo Hamid, we're all with you, Hamid I'm from the town of Chaouen.
Salam. I am Latifa from Tangier. I want to study in a vocational training centre. However, I have difficulties because I left school at the eighth grade and they don't accept this level in my town.
Salam. I will talk directly about the topic. We have problems with Sawla because it doesn't open its doors to everyone.
I love you Abdelhamid, I'm Abdelali from Chaouen Morocco
Salam alikum. I am 18. I have a degree of lower secondary education. I studied one year in the secondary. I would like to know available training opportunities in the vocational training centers. Is it possible to help me? Thank you!
I will write you again. I have just registered my membership. Thank you very much for this site which will enable us to present all our questions about our future. I wish success to all young men and young girls. Peace, mercy and blessings of God be upon you.
Salam. I am a student. I was studying in the fifth year of the secondary. One day, a teacher quarreled with one of my friends who was not my classmate. One day, I asked him to teach us an additional course at home. He accepted. We went to study. My friend asked the teacher if he can study with us. The teacher replied no, people like you don't study extra hours. They quarreled. The teacher told me it is not good you brought him, I will ruin you. When I received my exam paper, I had 0 in French and I didn't pass. I dropped out of school as I didn't want to repeat the year. Now, I want to study in vocational training.
I am a young man, 18. I have studied in the vocational training centre in Safi in electricity for one year and half. Are there any prospects in terms of jobs?
I am very impatient this year and hope that you will do something good, God willing.
I want to participate in Star Academy VI. I wish Dia and Saad good luck, I wish you success and brightness in the Star Academy VI. Long live Dia. Thank you.
Hi. I am Assmae from Morocco. I love you Star Academy so much and wish all the participants success and victory in this program. The problem, however, is that there is no relationship between our Star Academy and that of Lebanon. I hope that our Star Academy will also make a bit of progress. So good luck to everyone.
I hope that there will be different singing channels like Siham group and Lamchahb group, for example. This is kh
I am Hanan from Morocco. I love you so much and I hope that you will speak in Moroccan dialect like everyone else speaks in his or her dialect in the house. I wish Diaa success and Mostapha I love you so much. May God assist you all. Hanan from Morocco.
Star academy is a den for prostitution, the daughters of Arabs are in danger.
Long live Star Academy. Long live the Rif.
I want to participate in Star Academy.
Thank you for your efforts!
We hope that you will make exams easier this year. Thank you!
You are talking about the involvment of Algeria...well-done...but you are good for the dustbin...what an analysis!
Hassan El Fad, I am one of your fans. Why don't you participate in new films, even if you are a comedian of the first class in Morocco and in respect to all the Moroccan comedians for their efforts to make us happy. I hope that there will be a common show between Said Ennaciri, Mohamed Alkhiyary and Hassan El Fad.
Salam alikum. My name is Hakima from Salé. The team of Salé was the best team. It is As-Salé. There is a difference from the team of Salé. We in the team of As-Salé are lucky and make the best team. We want to put hand in hand and become as we were to be the best team again. The best team is As-Salé, ok!
First of all, I would like to thank you for this site. My greatest dream is to become a football player. However, conditions don't help me. Anyway, I wish all Moroccan teams success in their career. I ask them how I can join a team. Thank you! I would like to play in any team. Is this possible?
Your word remind me of a past and old feeling no matter how it was. I liked so much living this moment.
Nasro, I love you to death. There is no one like Nasro. No I don't think there is someone like Nasro in this world. I love you to death.
I need someone to help me.
Hassaniya, honestly this year I will participate in the national exam of the baccalaureate. My question is why don't you make the common curriculum universal in all Morocco because other books are different in some courses. I want the reply very soon please. Your sister Hasaniya Zinbl from Agadir.
May God reward you
Thanks to the Dutch Organization for this project. I want to ask: why isn't this programme expanded to all our country? Our country, thank God, has all the resources. Or will only those who have money live as they wish, and the poor sit down? [Expletive deleted]
Aids disease is very dangerous for the program Sidaction
Ceeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeertainly sister Maryam.
Moroccan rap is the best music in the world because of: bigg h_name, h_kayne, casa crew and steph rega man.
Salam alaikoum I love Fnaire and H-Kayne to death, I wish them success inchallah.
The best singer is Bigg, Casa Crew and H-Name so much, I wish you more success like this.
I support the idea of a national coach. However he must be of a high standard. We have this coach but why isn't he granted an opportunity even if during the period of Badou Zaki he was a competent man. We hope from people who have concern for the national team to call the national coach Abdelghani Naseri and give him his right.
Criminal, may God take revenge on them.
Salam. I want you people to consider with me this. We have the best team in Africa and don't know how to use it. Shame on us. From the goalie Lamyaghri + fagrouch + zaza in the defense rbati , Lkarkari, waddo, ben atia, ben Aaskar, bassir, Kadori in the midfield safri, kharja, kabous, lahmadi, zammama, in the offensive hadji, taarabat, aboucharwan, laaloudi, chammakh, lhamdawi, baha, bossofa ... with these players, Cameroon will no longer be the indomitable lions, they will make them defeated donkeys. However, people in the federation want us to be
Zaki forever.
Salam alikum everyone. My Moroccan brothers everywhere especially in Morocco, concerning the sport policy in Morocco, it is a failure. What is this scandal brothers?
Jwiaa forever.
Salam. We don't want Roger Lemerre. All the Moroccan people don't want him. They all don't want him. Members of the federation who brought him should take him to their homes to train their wives and daughters. Oh people, we don't want him. Zaki forever.
I am Mohamed from Maghnia on the border with Morocco. I am in Morocco, in Oujda. I entered on the fences.
I hope that the Moroccan federation renews its contract with Badou Zaki to return to Atlas Lions. I prefer his salary will be higher than that of Henri Michel. The enemies of Zaki should leave the federation. The corrupt enemy should go out. We also hope that he gets it because we love watching the dear national team winning. Bravo Chamakh. Thank you.
I love Bado Zaki.
Salam. We want Morocco to be nice from now on, to fight corruption and even prostitution which is spread in Morocco. We shouldn't just fight administrative corruption but also corruption on the streets.
Hi Hamid, you're the best candidate of Star Academy Maghreb, you've honoured us, you've a sweet and nice voice, God help you, good luck. Hamid from Casa, Morocco
Hi everyone, how are you, I would like to say that I love you so much
I vote for Hajar, long live the beauty of Moroco, I love you Hajar...Khayri a star
Khairi went out on his own initiative no one told him go out, it's his will
I'm a fan of Hamid, Farah and Hajar, you're all stars, I'm from Chaouen.
Hi everyone and I say to Nadoura congratulations my love. It is better that you go back to Manel because she loves you so much. I also love you. Good luck, a kiss. Tunisia is with you.
Congratulations to the star Naddoura. With the will of God, God will grant you happiness and preserve you for all Tunisians.
I'm From Morocco I want good life and Good bliss I want peace in the entire world. Thanks :-) for this site and i support it for boosting communication between Maghreb people in particular and all the people in general. God grants success to everyone.
Salam alaikoum. It's Morocco which will take it inchallah and Chamakh is the scorer of the Cup. Morocco forever.
God is the greatest! There is no other god but God, Mohammed is the messenger of God. I will sacrifice my soul for you, o messenger of God!
That's it, normally they should stone her to death. She should wear religious hijab or remove it altogether. Most young girls have become hypocrites.
I am Moroccan, I die for Morocco. However, by God, we have good boys, they are great in play. If some think they are the national team, they must go away my brother. These include Mouman and the two others with him. Now we can do nothing; we have to look ahead, ok.
Shame on these comments that damage the religion of Islam!
Salam alikum. These don't belong to the Sunni Salafism, the rescued group which will be victorious and which was described by the prophet of God, peace and blessings of God be upon him, as the rescued. This is the Takfirist Jihadist Salafism following the the Takfirist approach of Sayed Qotb. If anyone of you criticises Salafism, he is in this way criticising the righteous Salaf who are the Companions of the prophet, their followers and followers of the followers. If you successors people insult Salafists, on the Day of Judgment we will hold you accountable before the hands of God and you won't be excused for your ignorance!!! These are followers of Ghazali, Charaoui and Maoudoudi. Salafists are fighting polytheism which makes the individual dwell eternally in hell. The country is full of idols and shrines worshipped instead of God. As for sins, we fight them with the heart!! We don't disobey the ruler. We call for unity of the three sections. We seek knowledge unlike you Sufism, Acharis, bankrupt Brotherhood, Jahmiya, Moutazila, Koramia, Kolabia, the twelve Zaidia Nosayria Imamia and the 72 stray groups. We believe in the hadith of division, texts of promises and warnings. We don't follow unspecific verses. We are the salafists. So show us what you successors have done! It is God Whose help is sought and we rely on Him!
I want the national team to win
The level of Morocco in studies has gotten weak as a result of the subpar policy. We requested that you update it. Long live Mohammed 7
We always hear this but we haven't seen anything of it.
I agree with students who say that education is threatened. If it remains in this situation persist in future, students who pass every year in the baccalaureate with a good score will drop. But those who pass without distinction don't have any post-graduate opportunities. No school will accept them. This means they have no future. I don't know why they let them pass without distinction. They must give them another opportunity to have a better score better than no distinction which won't help them presently. Education has reached is very deteriorated and vulgarized.
I thank you for this site. I advise every young man not to smoke during his period of studies. Thank you very much.
It was difficult even if I passed, I wasn't expecting to pass without honours.
Good luck.
Where are you Charaf? Send me the film.
I am really tired. By God this is an injustice and more than an injustice. This year I failed in the ordinary session. I knew I didn't do well in the Spanish subject. That day I had a bad problem. But I said I will sit again for that subject in the second session. I was sure I did well. I expected to pass. When the results were announced, it was the most terrible shock, I didn't pass. I nearly died of this. I am sure I replied and replied well. The biggest problem is that 2 students passed in our class. This is the ugliest and most unjust policy I saw in my life. I hope from God to take revenge on them, oh Lord. God suffices me and He is the best mandate against them and against their policy.
How are you? Well, my opinion about this site is that we need pictures. Thank you.
This is what I was looking for.
I want a file about world war II. Thank you.
Salam alikum. I want to know what happened in World War I.
The rate of unemployment has increased, so we need a solution.
Unemployment has eaten us, we endure hardships in studies and at the end we sit at home.
I want to know when are we going to find a solution to the problem, we young people, are facing.
Congratulations to Morocco and women's freedom. Here in Sweden they discuss whether this girl is fasting during the game or not, please reply. Long live Moroccan women. Happy Eid.
Hey how's it going? Really, this site is great... We can find more solutions about this event which was very dangerous for every Moroccan person. Thank you for giving us this info out of goodwill. I thank everyone involved in presenting this article!! Hicham
I really think this is good research.
Salam alikum. Thank you very much for this nice topic. May God reward you with good. I want to know from where I can get argan saplings because our village is on the outskirts of Essaouira. May God reward you.
Salam. My name is Redouane from Fes. My father is sick. He has heart troubles. I don't have financial resources to offer him treatment in a private hospital. I took him to a public hospital and found special difficulties to the point that I took my father back home ailing as I can't do anything to him. To this day, I am still waiting. What can I do?
I am an Amazigh woman. I love Argan oil. I thank you for this topic because it is very good.
God is the greatest.
Thank you for your interest. We hope to see the good.
I am a painter and have a diploma in textile. I am jobless. I want work.
I support the new constitution and new policies because they take into consideration people's interests.
Very good.
Salam alikum. Everything that was said really exists. I say this because I have a unilateral agreement. God is our witness that our rights are devoured. I am not going to talk about what was previously said. There are also the rights of pregnant women, which do not exist. When she gives birth, she must work after only one month. She has no right to one hour of breast-feeding. So what can be said after all this? There are also mistreatment and delays. God suffices us and He is the best mandate!
Voice of haraga.
Salam alikum. I am a Moroccan young woman. I am married to a Moroccan man in Morocco. We moved to live in Italy. After two years of marriage, my husband wants now to divorce for unclear reasons. Can he divorce in my absence and without my knowledge in Morocco? Can we divorce in Italy? Please if anyone has information about the topic, help me! Thank you!
If you hadn't run away, they would have killed you.
I didn't pass last year and this year I worked better than last year although the exam was slightly tougher. However, I only managed a re-sit. They are slightly unfair in correction. Although they controlled cheating, there are some people who passed thanks to cheating. This is a shame! May God grant success to everyone!
FAR forever.
I love you Hend because I am your friend from Tunisia. We have studied together. Your name was Oumayma. You used to despise me.
You are nice my darling. I adore you and wish you good luck, ok.
I haven't passed in the ordinary session this year 2010. I hope to pass in the re-sit. Pray with me and with all Moroccan girls to pass!
There is no back and nothing after it. What will all students do after the bac? Nothing!
Is there any girl who has AIDS, HIV, who wants to marry?
Salam. I want please the address of the association.
Do you know a girl who has AIDS, wants to marry and repent to God? Please guide me to addresses of centres in Morocco or phone numbers of these associations. God the Almighty is forgiving and no one can give his judgment in the decision of God. How many kids have AIDS? Is God punishing him? How many criminals take the money of orphans, commit obscenities daily, how many kills souls? But they don't have AIDS. Help your brothers who have the disease. Is diabetes a punishment from God? Is cancer a punishment from God? Thank you! May God heal every patient!
I didn't like it.
Hi! I am Naima from Morocco. I would like to salute you for your great morals and principles. Thank you!
Good evening, all friends! By God, my brother, you didn't lie! There is just favouritism. Even though I passed the bac with honours, I got it just with brazenness. There is just pushing, that's all. May God do some good in this Morocco, that's all!
Many congratulations Antar, many congratulations Lila, Antar is the best footballer!
Allow me to tell you that you are prominent in this programme.
Congratulations Antar!
Fashions of Morocco are great and up to the expected level.
I am dressmaker of traditional and modern dresses. I like traditional dresses so much because it reflects traditions of our country.
Concerning me, I haven't seen anything so that I can express my opinion. Sorry.
This news is nice!
Salam alikum. My name is Nadia and I like the traditional caftan. I wish success to the Moroccan dress because I do the same work, which is traditional dresses. This is my job. I am proud of my work because I like it so much. I wish more innovations for the Moroccan caftan. I thank everyone who contributed to this site. Bye!
Salam. Loubna. I am very happy with this site. I am very interested in it. Thank you very much to the staff of the site. Thank you very much.
I am one of the most fervent fans of Annas. I hope the oblivious will wake up and boycott pornographic channels which have corrupted the Arab Nation in general and young people in particular.
Woooooooooooow, craziness! I am mad about you!
I also like design of dresses. I want to become a famous designer. Thank you for the Moroccan Caftan.
I am the son of Souss. I play in the cadets of Hwara. I would like to enroll.
My name is Nabil Manssouri. I would like to join the academy or apply to it.
Happy Ramadan! We fast in order to be rewarded. As for work, there are no jobs in Morocco. They don't want to give us jobs. They fear that we compete with them. They have reduced all the salaries of workers in the private sector. On the other hand, they increased prices of taxis and food stuff. What country is this? You have made us hate it with your lies. You are unbearable. Unemployment has increased a lot this year in Morocco. There are many poor people who went to prison this year because of the loans they took from banks. Shame on you to demean the Moroccan people!
How are you? I am Chadya from Casablanca. I wish Bassma Boussil a happy life God willing.
His name isn't Hajib. His name is Toufiq Hazeb. Some learning. She is a poor one this Iman, go, Bigg is the best singer of Rap in Morocco and we are with you Bigg. Come one, we are Moroccans to death. I wanted to say one thing. It is not Morocco which is underdeveloped, it is the people on it, (expletive) on those who don't like Bigg because he says the truth or because he doesn't sing about "my darling or my soul" you insult him because he defends you, you hate him because if it were someone else not Moroccan,Amr Diab, Nanci or Elissa, they would have accommodated her in the best hotel and …Respect Moroccans, we must work together so that we can realize something. We are playing, when we see someone we start applauding, just heading like donkeys. This was even before the rap comes but now Bigg has come and he has lightened our road and this channel, may God reward it with good shouldn't show a lot of films because they increase unemployment. I say to this girl who likes films and Adil Imam to listen to a song by Bigg and fill her time with something, because they cause obesity. Thank you very much Bigg. I love you, go on. Without you we are nothing 0 and we wouldn't have survived for one day. May God protect you for us and grant you long life.
Hi how are you? I want to tell you that there is nothing like your album in Morocco. I want to tell you that it is you whom I love so much. So if you don't mind, we are a band and have one problem, we haven't found anywhere to record our discs. We have one album bearing the title Oulad Zanka (children of the street). It has ten songs. If you don't mind, help us somehow. May God protect you, may God protect you...
Big, what is wrong with you? Stay dense and stout. You are a lit spliff and I don't need to smoke you. Will you tell me who has taught you and made you know the words of rap? Who will adopt your father or your brother? You still don't want to wake up and be aware that you are heading down a dangerous road? Big, look, you're not a rap singer or anyting. You are attacking rap.
I am not insulting. I hate Morocco's policy, so when I am angry, I listen to Bigg.
Terrorist.
Sleeping and laziness is sweeter than honey, wait is better than hoping!
If possible, I would like to receive the address of some counseling centers in Agadir.
I loved this channel: Nesma TV and I hope they air religious films and songs!
There should be honesty. Everyone should know all the affairs of the state.
Happy New Year Ghani Kabbaj. I wish him more success. I personally wish him and his family a happy new year. Laila Benk.
I like the singer Ghani. I like his songs. I wish him success in his life. My greetings to Chab Ghani.
The best Arab singer
I like all songs of Ghani. This is the first time I read his biography, date and place of birth.
Salam. I wish you all success in your life.
It is a bad phenomenon and competent parties should intervene.
We've seen nothing.
Hi Hajar, I'm Samia from Morocco, I love you so much, by God I voted for you because I love you so much.
The Moroccan policy is a great policy. However, there are those who exploit power for machines like this terrorism.
I witness there is no other god but God and I witness Mohammed is the messenger of God, peace and blessings of God be upon him, the last messenger and prophet.
They are worried about Islam. This is why they draw these pictures because they are worried.
You must authorize French to set up this association which is very important and I am sure of its success.
God willing, the gold medal in the Beijing Olympics and the Moroccan flag will be very high. Good luck to Abdelkader Zrouri.
You are arrogant, you don't deserve to be a champion.
I will sacrifice my father and mother for you messenger of God, we won't give in to what is said by some extremists. We have to struggle and support the messenger of God. This is possible by first supporting him in ourselves, families and societies.
Salam alaykoum. I say no to terrorism and violence. Islam isn't responsible for these negotiations. Peace should be present everywhere, especially in Palestine. The Israeli enemy is destroying Muslims, these negotiations should be solved everywhere.
I think that women cannot carry out the requirements of the public opinion. This is what can be said.
I congratulate you. Good luck, miss.
My name is Zahra from Constantine. By God, this is unacceptable!
In my opinion, the Moroccan policy should be changed as well as the prime minister.
Salam alikum. I am 26. I have been married to a girl for one year. This girl cannot have children. I want to divorce. What are steps to follow? Thank you!
Drugs are the evil of the era. We must be careful about them especially in adolescence. Thank you.
I don't understand why the Moroccan Government cut off relation with Venezuela and Hugo Chavez the leader of the Arab and Muslim world. I am sure the Moroccan people love him because he put the Arabs and Muslims high when the Arab hypocrites humiliated themselves, Arabs and Islam.
I am 13. However, I am not like others because my opinion about this topic is that he should be killed.
I am from Agadir. I am 18. I wish success to everyone in their career because its role was limited to the region of Agadir. If only the numbers of such associations in this level increase and do something for young people in particular. Ok, bye.
I am Amina from Agadir. I am 23. Honestly, we were happy to have such associations in Agadir and which care about women topics. I hope you will send me the address of your association. Thank you very much. I wish you success.
I want to become a nurse, God willing, or medical assistant.
Hi how are you? I want to tell you something: bring back the Star, it is nice by God.
There is no power and no will but from God. I witness there is no other God but Allah Who has no associate and I witness that Mohamed is the messenger of God.
People from the Rif take the poison out of their region to [sell] outside, despite the government efforts to prevent them from doing that, why man, as a result Morocco is now full of young drug addicts, who are everywhere, streets, buildings and so on.
I would like to know the address of an aesthetic surgery specialist in Tangier, I need it very soon please. Thank you very much.
You are either wrong in what you say or I don't know anything about Islam.
LONG LIVE FLN IN FRENDA WILYA TIARET AND BENASLA AHMED+FNA BELHOUARI THANK YOU, BE NUMerous.
Hi Chamakh. How are you. I'm one of your fans. I hope to see you as soon as possible and you be close by. I love you and I wish, my wishes, I wish to be a skilled player like you. Finally, I love you to the last minute. Wafae+Chamakh= love.
Nano, you are the most beautiful thing witnessed by my eyes. You are the angel of life, my angel, all my soul. I love you so much my life. God willing, you will be the most beautiful woman on earth. I cannot describe to you my love. I love you so much you and Fadoud.
This is the best thing achieved by this organization because corruption is on the rise in the Arab world.
.....Nasro is showy, not on the level and sick...
This is not acceptable.
Always Always Always
I hate Moroccan films
Is it you who knows better or God?
May God reward you with good for this job!
Please I dont love Maghreb movies like I love the Egyptian ones. These are better because their actors know how to portray roles and influence the audience. I wish Maghreb movies improve so that we take pride in them and in following them because they do have talents that need to be invested to raise from the low status we are in. I wish this request is heard and achieved even though I dont know wish to become an actress or producer...I wish to get a job in the tourist market God willing. Good luck to you from the bottom of my heart and please give is better articles in the future. thanks
Raja forever.
The Moroccan league is no longer as it used to be. They have to take this sport seriously so that it will return to its former level. Thank you.
Honestly, the one who said that they can be naked should be educated again. This is because we are in a Muslim country. You seem to forget yourself. They talk about freedom! May God curse those who educated you! Of course those who educated are parents who didn't know how he would grow up, pfff???
with Alloudi this year, Raja this year will get the African league cup!
Long live Algeria.
Morocco is a strong country. It doesn't fear Polisario or Algeria. Morocco forever from Sahara to the Boughaz Go, go, go Morocco resisting! Thank you.
I like this article so much because they are excellent. The festival is very nice.
You're very odd people. Let Libyans alone! You have nothing to do with them. Mind your own business and your countries, then you can talk about Libyans.
Ba Hassan may God protect you.
We have our own date and not the hegira.
I'm Arab, but my son is half Arab and half Berber. We're brothers whether you want or not. Saad.
Salam, I'm a fan of Soufiane El Alloudi and wish him success in his football career and wish that you'll take the title of best scorer for the year 2008 with wishes of success to Morocco.
I have nothing to say. Everything that I say is true. May God take revenge on the correctors if they have cheated us.
I ask God that the second session will be easy, that teachers will be a little understanding and not be severe with us in correcting because we need to pass.
Salam alikum everyone. What I will tell you is the following: may God reward everyone according to his intention. May God take revenge. May God bring us good results in this second session.
Salam my brothers, salam my sisters. I am Noureddine, one of the victims of the ordinary session. Can you imagine with me what my grade was? I had 9.97. Praise be to God, I still have self-confidence to pass in the second session. I had 11.32 and 10.32 in the regional exams but no luck. I ask you, my brothers and sisters, to pray with me that I pass. Salaam.
May God guide them!
Good luck to everyone.
Hi, happy Eid. Congratulations to all Algerians!
In reality, the Moroccan cinema is still giving. It is now competing with Egyptian or American cinema. This is an achievement. God bless you. More work. God bless all actors. Bye.
He was a leader and died as leader!
I am Mustapha. We're with your Greens and with you, Saadane. God willing, we'll beat them 3-0. We have great players. May God protect you and help you. 1, 2, 3 long live Algeria!
We are all brothers and sisters, only political games create problems and borders between Moroccans and Algerians.
I think Facebook has real influence in the world. There are over 12500 subscribers in Facebook.
What can I tell you? We are always the victims. I am from Zagora and there are always strikes. One female employee has been absent for one month. We haven't studied one subject for a month and no one speaks. There is still the baccalaureate exam. Moreover, we're the first to begin studies. Teachers hurry in order to complete courses whether you understand or not, it's not important. There are 40 students in the class. Do you think these are studies? This is just a loss for us. We have all passed the bac, but is there really any qualification? What do you think? There are no real studies in Zagora.
I ask God the Almighty that the exams this year be easy for everyone, especially the baccalaureate. It's illogical that the student studies for 13 years and you give him days in which his fate is settled. This problem has to be reviewed. You have all consideration.
Salam alikum, my brothers. If you want to pass, work hard and rely on God. God won't disappoint you! God grants success, so rely on God!
May God protect you for your effort, but the state doesn't want the people to study because we are Moroccans 100%.
By God if I catch correctors, I will beat them!
We have to fight corruption. But it is a shame and disgrace to remove her clothes on the streets. In Qur'an, the adulterer and adulteress should be whipped 100 times. This is what should be implemented.
Salam alikum. I'm in the baccalaureate this year. I ask you to provide us with information or samples of the national exam. I think that it's possible to pass; you should just be optimistic as long as you're preparing for the exam. I want samples, please!
Hi everyone! I would like to know the date of the baccalaureate exam this year.
May God rest the souls of Kadhafi and Saddam Hussein in peace!
Hajar is one of the nicest girls in Star Academy Maghreb in everything- in her beauty in her photos. I wish her a happy life and a good career crowned by success and inchallah she will be more famous than all singers!! Hajar forever, Hajar forever, Hajar forever.
I am a student in the sixth grade. I would like to know the score required for Errachidia school.
Salam alikum. I am a first year student in baccalaureate experimental sciences. I would like to know what my prospects are after the baccalaureate.
I need guidance about universities in Morocco.
I would like to know the score required by each school for enrollment.
Hi everyone! I passed the baccalaureate SVT. Congratulations to me and to all successful students. I would like to know the prospects of this specialty please.
I sing very well. When will the casting be held?
We like so much this show. I would like to participate because I sing well. Thank you!
I don't know Zakaria if your parents haven't brought you up well, first of all it's woman who needs rights not like man, and the clothes you described as short, this is a new era and a new time
1, 2, 3 long live Algeria.
Salam. I am Dikra from the city of Larache. I am concerned about the topic of violence against women in general. Woman is considered half the society. For me, this is the part in which she can act. Thank you.
Salam alikum. I am Siham from Agadir. I think that violence against women is a hideous facet of our Arab culture, especially Moroccan. Our beloved Prophet advised us about the importance of respecting women. The way a woman dresses is not associated with the problem of violence against women.
Long live Algeria. I die for you, my country. May God protect you from the [evil] eye, say amen.
To say the truth, I agree with you brother Ziko, women of these times, God protect us, that's all.
My sister Nissrine, I agree with you. Violence against women is always present wherever you go by God.
By God, explain to me one thing. My brother, you aren't God to judge people. Everyone is free in his acts. The problem of people is the following: the living is expensive and there is no job. That's all! What is wrong with them? You will find all problems with Arabs. They didn't lie when they said "When it is Arabized, it is ruined."
I love you I love you Asma take care of Adnan so much.
Salam alikoum. I love Jamal and want to see his songs.
Salam. I wish Zaki would return to the national team because he knows how to lead the national team. You've seen what he did when he led the national squad in the African Cup in Tunisia. They've reached the finals. But it was the mistake of the goalie Fohami that cost the national team victory. Therefore, I ask Zaki to return, especially now that we're in a crucial period, because Togo has withdrawn from the African Cup and we're qualified to take the opportunity. Bring back Zaki and trust him. When he comes, we can take the African Cup 2010, God willing. Bring back Zaki. He's the best coach who's ever led the Moroccan national team.
I need a plan.
Congratulations to Libyaaaaa!!!
Hajar is very beautiful.
I am Loubna from Morocco. I hope from all my heart that the Arab Maghreb will succeed. Long live Meknes.
I love you Hajar. I am Fatima Zahra from Agadir.
No, no, Kadhafi is strong! We can't forget the mentality is the same, they will sweep street by street. You are still moving forward, where do you want to reach rats? Dance and sing!
Salam. I work in the sector of building. My monthly income is 2500 dirhams. I would like a loan from Fogarim in order to buy an apartment. Therefore, I ask you to explain the concept of Fogarim loan and necessary conditions to get that loan. Thank you!
In the name of God. I am a Moroccan young man. I hope that officials will consider young people in the working districts of Rabat. Thank you!
I want a house which I need because my wife, my son and I live in a house on the terrace.
Thank you for the death of Kadhafi!
Salam alikum. I am a young man, 25. I live in Italy. I have been working for two years. I would like to buy a house in Morocco with a loan. What are necessary papers and conditions? Thank you!
Moroccans should not care about Christianity. They should implement their Islam which was neglected by some people. I say this with sourness. If tears were useful for Muslims, I would have wept blood.
Praise be to God.
This is ugly.
Peace be upon you, I would like to know the effects of AIDS.
AIDS is killing people but you are still doing nothing to stop it.
I am very happy as I am Tunisian. Channel 7 has changed into Tunis Nat but it is still Tunis 7 channel.
Where are the days of Fatin and Kawtar, the Dar without them is valueless, it's better that Dounia goes out because she doesn't deserve to stay, about the best voice in the Dar it's the Hajar and Firas, I love Khairi and Ahmed so much, and on this occasion I want to say to Nessma may God preserve you for us I would also like to say to all to all viewers to pray for the dear sister Maryem to recover quickly, Oh God, pray for her
the Dar without Jamal is nothing Fatin and Kawtar, by God the one who should go out from the house is Dounia and Yousra alone I want to address a message to all viewers I love I what can I do, reply to me as soon as possible
You are a star!
I want Fakhir to go away from the national team which isn't his.
Hakim that's hard...we love you more
I follow Jawad Zairi but don't know his career now. I don't know where he plays. Please follow up on this player who has great skills.
Long live Algeria. Long live Algeria. Zidane is a Harki (pro-colonizer) not an Algerian. So long live Algeria. Long live Ziani, Bouguerra, Belhadj, Matmor, Bouaaza, Ghiless, Mansori and all the national team, this is all.
sing us a little
I liked this site. May God grant you success my brother I wish you more and wish some praise.
I admire the audacity of the great artist Mohamad Shokri but I don't agree with him when he hated and despised his mother.
Thank you.
Shame on you! Islam disavows you. If you live in bounty and are ungrateful, you will be deprived of it without feeling it. Salam alikum sons of America.
Congratulation Libya!
Is it possible for someone who is 18 to register or not?
O Lord, grant victory to Islam and Muslims!
Oh my country, my country, I miss you my country.
Salafists are mentally sick. Most of them are drug-addicted. Their problem is that they are frustrated because they don't have the attention of girls. What they did to that victim is not jealousy for religion or the country. It is hatred. These are the ones we must fight not the clothes. I have an observation, you will find that most of them have harassed their sisters.
I want to buy a house.
Congratulations: Algeria 2 - Egypt 0.
By God I want to know everything about the African championship. I hope to be a good coach. Pray for me please.
Long live Mestaghanem and the poems of Sidi Lakhadar!
Hello. Congratulations.

Greetings to you, please excuse me because I am illiterate. I have the spirit of the Amazigh, long live the democratic Amazigh party. Ait Baghanja Lahcen, from the south east of Morocco, Boghafer Saghro.
Long live Hajar, Abdelhamid, Farah and Kawtar, Yousra you're jealous of Hajar, I love you so much Kawtar, Yousra is the one who deserves to leave
I want to know how much I have in the account?????
I want you to bring Cheb Rizki this year.
Bless the Cheikh!!! I congratulate those who know the Cheikh and offer my condolences to those who don't know him!!!
Salam. I would like to inquire about the case of a man who has only a confirmation of a marriage certificate to enter his children into the civil status records in order to register them at school. He doesn't live with her currently and wants to marry. Does he have to divorce or can he simply remarry? He went to inquire and they told him you have to lodge a suit in the divorce court. Is this true? Or can he remarry to another woman he knows, since he only has a confirmation of marriage and had a previous experience? This man is going through hard conditions. The man with whom he has a confirmation of marriage causes him scandals. Thank you very much!
I like so much definition of Moroccan Kaftan. I hope you will write more about this field. I want to learn design and dressmaking. Thank you!
I want to become a designer.
Smoking is hazardous for health and should be avoided especially by teenagers because they are in a very dangerous age. This is why we must protect them and advise them. Therefore I say smoking is very hazardous for the health.
I am a young girl who wants the address of the association.
Respect for schools is necessary, ok
I want the address of these associations in Casablanca.
Anyone who is a terrorist isn't a human but an animal, and even the animal is better than him. Those who kill innocent people aren't human beings. Bin Laden is an animal. We want the entire world to live in peace. We have family, sons, mosques and a life but you terrorists are animals of this era. God does not approve killing a soul, you're terrorists you kill innocent people, you animals. You don't have a conscience. Zakaria Kamouss, Casablanca, Morocco
Congratulations Antar Yahia!
Stop talking and do what you mean. Everyone is just talking.
RAJA forever but we want Zaki, shame on you.
Hi how are you. I want to participate in star academy.
...Badro, Badro and Badro. I love you so much, so much, so much
Congratulations, Antar! I wish happiness for you and your wife Laila! Wishing you good descendants, God willing to everyone!
Cheb Nasro is a great singer. His songs are nice. I love him and wish him success.
Hi Nasro! I love you so much. I also sing rai. They say that I have a nice voice but I still don't have confidence in myself.
ess
Look we need first to change the federation then we can see where is the national team with the coach. It is the spirit of the football which we don't have. Look Mr Hassni Ben Slimane you're laughing at yourself and at us. Look for something else other than football. Badou Zaki forever.
Long live Morocco, long live Moroccan football.
I want Zaki or I will make a scandal if Zaki doesn't come.
I want a drawing of the long jump.
Peace be upon you my sister Samira. I love you very much!
I am very proud of this athlete.
How are you old woman. Are you not going to die?
I want a definition of the long jump.
Rams are very expensive in Algeria. Almost the majority doesn't slay rams in the Eid.
I want a clear explanation of this game. Ok, thank you for your efforts. Ok thank you so much.
I hope that the Moroccan government will create an initiative to protect the eastern regions from AIDS.
I like your site very much. Thank you for your site. Salam.
I love you so much; I love your great songs!
Well done!
My name is Taha from Algeria. I call upon all Arabs and lovers of our intercessor Mohamed to stand up for the support of our noble messenger to show the world how much we love our religion and our messenger because silence means that we accept this. We have to resist even we are to die because the messenger, peace and blessings of God be upon him, said that our dead people are in paradise and their dead people are in hell.
Salam. I want please exams of the second year of the baccalaureate modern literature. Please, thank you!
Indeed, Allah will not change the condition of a people until they change what is in themselves. Anyway, anyone who witnesses there is no other God but Allah and that Mohamed is the messenger of God must rise up to support him, peace and blessings of God be upon him.
We are all Muslims. Why should every group take a different name? We are Muslims followers of the prophet, peace and blessings be upon him.
In 2025, it will be fixed at 75 years...!
O Lord help us this year!
Wish success to everyone!
I am a fan of Wydad. My favourite team is the midfielder Issam El Adoua who plays like players in the national team. Issam. I love you El Adoua, wish you success El Adoua.
I prefer two coaches for the national team. The first is Assalami and the second is Aamouta. As to the goalies, I choose Abdellatif Laalou. Salam alikum.
Oh bring Zaki.
Zaki is the coach alone. Those who hate him don't wish the good of the country. Zaki, Zaki, Jawad Zairi, El Mokhtari and Chamakh.
Hi Marouan Chamakh. I am Kawtar from Kenitra. I love you so much because you play football very well. I wish you success. Thank you. Bye my love.
God willing, I'll pass the bac with some luck!
I wish the defeat of Morocco God willing.
I am Mohamed from Mokrisset. I am one of your real fans Rabie. I wish you success my brother.
Wadou Zaki forever.
I am concerned about OCK. But why is Ahmed Charbi not substituted? There is no democracy. He ruined the team. He has no concern about the team. Other teams bring in players but he has nothing to do of them. He keeps on selling to fill his pockets together with Jadir. Bngora was sold at 800, Brtage at least 300 F, 300, 250. Now he is free.
It is clear this is a late April fool. Why should poverty be fought only today? What do they call what Moroccans experience today? In addition to the government of Abbas El Fassi who has recruited all his relatives. They are saturated with money and they want their sons to be saturated as well. This is why they say now that they have to be with the people. A game, we understand who are masonry who rule the world with the plan which is known only by those who watch this YouTube video "Al Kadimon". Just enter and you will understand what happens with those who are faulty. If you don't understand, here is my face, write to me.
I am one of the fans of Nader and i wish him all the good and that he is happy all the time. But I also liked the son of my country Saad Ramadan however Nader is very good and it's as though the title was taken by Saad. I would like to say to Mohamad don't be sad.
Peace of God upon you. You have lifted our head Nader. We love you so much. I am Laila from Morocco.
I love you so much Saad, You're Number 1!!!!!!!
This is the first time I visit the site. I liked you but you must tackle many issues and extend more the site. I wish you success. Good luck.
Salam alaikoum. I would like to say to my brothers who oppose the coach Henri Michel, we're Moroccans and shouldn't look at the nationality or origin of the coach. We should rather look at his performance. The coach Henry Michel is now going on the right path but there were some mistakes in the game of the lions against Guinea. They were rectified at the beginning of the second half by entering Marwan, Bouchayb and Abocharwan. In my opinion, they should be steady and achieve victory against Ghana on Monday to go to the second round. I wish victory to the Lions and return to the Moroccan people namely, and I wish quick recovery to the striker Soufiane Alloudi and hope that the Moroccan team will present a match to the required level; with wishes of success inchallah. Salam.
You have your religion and I have my religion
The Moroccan girl doesn't control her acts because her life is not organised. Now the young girl goes out with the young man she wants and he controls her but she doesn't know that he is just wasting his time with her. Once he is bored with her, he goes to another girl. But the girl isn't aware of this until she finds herself pregnant. Then, regret is of no use. She thus loses her life because of her love.
I agree with the issue of hijab. This is why they should keep it… Woman must demand her right…
I hate Chab Nasro with all my heart because he ruins the lives of young men and gives them songs that aren't up to par.
Hello! "So whoever wills - let him believe; and whoever wills - let him disbelieve." Everyone should wear whatever they want. If you are not happy with this, stay home, close your eyes or go to Sahara!
Happy Eid!
Greetings! My name is Mohamed Rafie. I want to learn about this radio. Can you help me? Thanks
It is really unjust of these teachers who increase lessons. I am really confused with this resit and numerous lessons.
http://sadi9i.com/vb/showthread.php?t=4613 this is a good site you will find in it everything. I found everything in it. I checked the file of history and it was right… Good luck.
I will post you this topic in a few days. Wait for the reply. Salam alikum. May God reward assist you. Azeddine from Beni Mellal.
I hope the exam this year will be easy. I wish good luck to everyone!
As a student from the city of Safi, I strongly condemn this terrorist act. From God we are and to God we shall return for all the victims of this attack.
We thank you for your good response to us.
Pride to you. We want more youth programmes.
Rafie, it's television not radio
This year I failed in the ordinary session, but I'm entitled to sit for the second session. Why is the passing rate for it so low? I hope the exam will be easy, because I hope to pass.
These people are getting mad. People are working rapidly. Appoint fair police officers and gendarmes, curse it, in every road point. Ghellab should go take the cover, he has (unclear) the servants of God, with politics.
My name is Khadija. I am 23 years old. I like Moroccan traditional dresses.
We thank you for this comment.
I love Argan because it is good for the health and muscles.
No, no, no to opening the border!
Please protect this tree.
I left school in the third year of the bac. I have a diploma in plumbing. I want Anapec to address me information about this.
I hope from God that you will do what you say. Our Morocco will become then one of the best countries. I hope there will be a rehabilitation of young people in Morocco.
God willing, we will win 5-0. We have to win.
Great topic by God.
May God grant success to our Algerian national team. God willing, we'll beat them in Egypt. God willing, amen.
Honestly, I personally was expecting the result of the national team for many reasons. First of all, why have they left Zaki? Honestly, if we want to progress, the federation must involve the Moroccan people in appointing the coach through elections via msn.
These parties are useless and the people of Morocco can take their rights on their own. The government has plundered the people but we're still patient. However, patience has limits.
Hi Hajar, I love you so much. Pleas don't lose hope and always be what you are. Hi the star of the Maghreb Starac and the star of the Maghreb.
God bless you Hajar, I consider what you did courageous on your part. Those people have taken your right and God will not let you down, go on like this and we're always with you. And all Moroccans are with you. You're very dear and the Maghreb Star'Ac without you is nothing. Long live Hajar, long live the beauty of Morocco.
I love Algeria and its people so much.
The Arab Maghreb cannot exist without Amazighs.
El Marzouki is not suitable as president.
Raja Casablanca forever and Real Madrid!
I'm a girl from the south... I wanted to ask: why doesn't Mosaique reach the south?
I am very happy for this nice and smart country which boasts Moroccan Jellaba and Caftan.
Salam alikum. We hope you will present the latest models in traditional dresses of our country as well as material. I wish success to all creative women in this field which is a honourable profession and very respectable dress.
I want to become a fashion model in future if you help me. Thank you!
Thank you!
God's curse on oppressors!
Salam. How are you? I am Nada. Your designs are great! I wish you success.
I like so much this academy even if I am old I would like to join it soon????
What happens is unacceptable!
God supports this religion with the believers and the infidels. "Argue with them in a way that is best."
Hi. I want to contribute.
I don't accept the words said by Mr Sabir. Star academy doesn't reflect the deterioration in the behaviour. It reflects creativity of the voice of Maghreb young people today. I advise you not to say such things about Morocco. Moroccans to death.
I am Mohammad Marour from the city of Fez. I like football. I previously played with the team of Wydad Sarghini. I loooove football.
Greetings of peace to you fellow brothers in faith, happy new year to all Moroccans. I just wanted to congratulate Mr. Taoufik (Bigg) who actually deserves every single piece of luxury he lives in and I wish him more because he speaks out the truth that no man dares to venture. Everybody wants him harmed, even the Muslims: is it because he is successful? I think he is beyond your schemes; he is real BIGG. If you really think he gave you a crappy album in 2006, wait until you see his hit in 2008 unless an Islamist blows himself up near him. We need rappers like him. I would abandon rap if I were you brother. Who cares about what you say, whether you claim to be a man or not. If you think you are good, why don't you produce an album as good as Bigg's. As the proverb says, birds of a feather flock together. Long live Bigg and long live Morocco- I wish all Moroccans success and our land is the best! Peace Citizen from Agadir
Had they tried you Mortada, Morocco would have been at the bottom, in terms of freedom.
How are you biiiiiiig you're great but you've done a disaster with those mad sons there are some mad people who don't understand Marrakech expects more from you and Fnair.
Good Satt you're going straight but beware of prison and 'Moroccans till death' are losing words.
Bigggggggg always Rap
Hi Bigg, you have a very good character.
I'm Hajar from Morocco, like you Hajar, my darling.
Fishing is nice in Morocco because it provides fish to people. But Mauritania made an agreement with Mauritania. This has contributed to the development of fishing in all the states of the European Union. Thank you for this research.
Salam alikum. I have great confidence in the Justice and Development party in general and Benkirane in particular. Change in Morocco will be in his hands, God willing! We support him in everything you adopt. May God grant him success and protect him for us, amen o Lord!!! Viva the Justice and Development party!!!!
I am Hossain. How are you Zidane and Ronaldo? How are you? I am from Tangier. What about you Ronaldo and Zidane? Where are you from?
Thank God, I trust the king Mohamed VI and head of the government Abdelilah Benkirane. They are going to serve the country, God willing, in the best way. If we want something which will make us happy, we have to be patient as we have been patient for years with those who were before them.
Peace be upon you, authentic Amazigh people and everyone who is here. I am very happy to talk to you. I wish success to the Amazigh channel. OK, kind greetings!
Wow, it has become a phenomenon in Morocco, many people and many officials should fight it not just by words, everything is clear, but we just need serious action, I'm sorry.
I love Ghani so much because he is handsome and his voice is nice and sweet. I want to have his phone number or meet him very soon because I love his songs so much. 1000000 to Ghani.
Salam alikum. This site is really great!
I miss Morocco so much, thank you.
Hi! I would like to set up an agricultural business (breeding milk cows). I have a diploma of agricultural qualification.
I am a Moroccan immigrant. I hope to set up an agricultural project in Morocco. I want someone who has experience in agriculture to give me an idea or information. I also raise cows. Thank you! Looking forward to a reply please!
I would like to work with you as a body guard.
Salam. I am one of the fans of Ghani. I wish him success in his life and his artistic career. He is one of the humble actors. Humbleness is everything in art. Ghani is also handsome and attractive. I am a fan of Ghani and the pop star Ramy Ayach because there is a resemblance between Ramy Ayach and Ghani. Sara.
Salam. I am Majid from Imzouren. I am 30. I have a business in welding. Thank you for this advice. Praise be to God for this successful project. I wish success to every young woman and man God willing!
Salam. I am Imad from Tangier. I have capital but have no idea.
I am a young man, 22. I have experience in poultry and rabbits farming. Therefore, I ask for your help and co-operation, please, in realising this dream I've cherished since I was young. Thank you very much!
There is no other God but Allah.
Allah will perfect His light, although the disbelievers dislike it.
This is not worthy of them.
There is no other God but Allah, Mohamed is the messenger of God. There is no power and no will but from God. The messenger of God is our beloved prophet. He is the last prophet and messenger. I love you o messenger of God.
What's wrong with you my beauty?
Always Moroccans, it's them who will win the starac
badrou, djamel, farid, you're amazing, really hicham has degraded us; Algerian princess
how are you I like Hajar Nessma
Salam, I'm Imane, I love Maghreb star academy
Hi the beauty of star Hajar and Badrou, by God the Greatest you're stars, and bravo Hajar, you're really the most beautiful of star, Wafae from Fés
Yes, their ages ranged between 15 and 25. This is the outcome of the destruction and corruption that America perpetrates against this category of society through the Internet and tourists. Salam.
O Lord support our religion and make us among those who support this religion, amen, you are capable of everything, amen!
Anything but the messenger of God! I will sacrifice my mother and father for you! This reflects the meanness and ribaldry of the director because Islam is the religion of love and most Christians embrace it. There is no other god but God.
May God grant success to everyone. I am happy when I see a Moroccan winning, especially in Taekwando. I practice this sport which I like so much. May God protect anyone who practices Taekwondo, and all sportsmen.
Congratulations, my brother! She is really lucky to have you.
Bassma star academy 6 is nice and kind. She was never a nominee. Bassma the Moroccan is the right star of the academy 6, 2009 not Abdelaziz. Long live Bassma. Long live Morocco.
I want please the address of a gynaecologist and information about the topic, thank you.
Good!
Salam alikoum. May God guide you. Everything you say is false. Long live Jihad as it is in the koran.
I liked this topic. I also liked even more its definition. I hope many people would read it. I thank the author of this topic because it is an interesting topic. Thank you!
This article is good, good, by God! Thank you for this article with all the information it presents! I learnt so much! Thank you very much!
I think there should be no studies, ok!
Long live al-Qaeda
Is this site what helps you create a fissure between brothers? Colonialists have already left enough destruction, you Arabs.
I want to say that this is not reasonable. Leave our country in peace, leave our sons in tranquillity. Morocco is the country of the forefathers and the saints. May God assist the king of Morocco Mohamed 6. Thanks to everyone.
Salam. I would like to thank you for these summaries. I would like to have summaries of the independence movements in the Arab east as soon as possible. Thank you!
Good points.
I like rap so much because I've listened to it since I was young. I dance hip-hop because rap is the dream I had, more than hip-hop. But now, praise be to God, I do hiphop and we make many competitions. Now we have come to the final stage. I hope to win together with my friends Radwan, Yassin and Mahdi.
Greetings, long live Farid Amazigh.
I love Farah so much and I liked her when she sang 'wayhabalmais', it's a pity, Yousra went out as well she also has a nice voice but anyway I hate Yousra and Jamal. Thank you, Hasna from Morocco.
Thank you for the interesting information. Now I hate Cheb Mami.
Salam alikum. By God it is odd! Some people want to defame the Salafist approach. By God, by God those who committed such acts aren't Salafists. They are some Takfirists and they are known. We hope that God the Almighty will take revenge on them. As for Salafists, they are a minority in this dear country. We ask God the Almighty to bless us with security and safety forever. One should read about the Salafist approach not just speak unknowingly. We ask God the greatest to protect the country from every secular who seeks to trample over the religion. We ask God to reform daughters of Muslims and guide them to the truth. Salam alikum.
Khaled, may God protect you from the eye, bring us the old hind.
May God curse them to the Day of Judgment, curse, curse, curse them.
Salam alikum. I am a young girl, 16, from Morocco. I am married and pregnant. The judge refused my request to marry and I am now pregnant. My husband accepts everything. What can I do? Please help me! I am confused. Looking forward to your reply. May God reward you with all the good!
Al Riyadia is a nice channel
Right, they should have adopted this. Had they adopted this, we wouldn't have been where we are now. I am 17. My parents wanted to make me get married. When I said to my father I want to work, he said I would kill you. Now I am patient but I won't live well because I didn't want to get married.
Under-age marriage was and is still practiced in Muslim countries. The prophet himself married an Under-age girl, Aicha. The prophet is our role model!!!
Salam. Even if I am homosexual (gay) I am against spreading the evil. Kif Kif doesn't represent homosexuals. Pray for me to be guided and healed. Salam.
The fate of these girls is unacceptable.
Long lives Nasrou!
I love your voice Cheb Nasrou!
I don't like the style of Nancy in singing. I don't like it.
For me and for all Moroccans, you're the best singer. I love you of millions of loser singers. I like your nice songs and your fascinating look. Thank you!
I am Moroccan. I am producing a film. The story is about a handicapped person at work. I want comments.
Salam. Ramadan is great in Algeria. I hate Ramadan in Egypt because they are big dirty dogs.
Wydad is stronger than Raja by 100000000000000000000000000000000000000000 times
I like cinema and acting. My wish is to become a famous actor. I am Moroccan and have the Moroccan citizenship.
I am Moroccan, I love Moroccan films so much.
I am one the most fervent fans of Awlad Leblad. God help them and finish their studies!
Go ahead Wlad Leblad you will succeed God willing.
Salam alaikoum and mercy of God.
Does this pay increase and adjustment of situation of workers cover also paper who work without official papers such as employees of Euro Sol and offices workers or what? We didn't understand anything about this law Mr Abbas!
Salam. Waw Hassan El Fad, he is an exception in the Moroccan comedy. He is the top. I like so much his way. This is really cool. Good luck Si Hassan. Make us laugh and come out on TV. A big greeting to all the people who love Hassan El Fad.
Pride brother Hassan, you are great.
Honestly, prosperity to Hassan El Fad. I am waiting for your new works.
You are all talking nonsense.
We will bring it in the World Cup, God willing!
Congratulations to us on qualifying for the World Cup!
To tell the truth, education in Morocco is still lacking so many things. But thanks to God, this is not just the case in morocco, but in all Arab countries. I hope there will be an interest in this sector as all developed countries have achieved development thanks to this sector. As to you Hamza, don't worry, the exam will be inchallah easy. But in spite of that you should review your lessons from the beginning. Ok?
Thank you for this modest interview, especially because there are things we didn't understand.
Thanks for the stadium
I'm a Sahrawi fan of Widad and a son of Laayoune. Long live WAC!
Wydad Forever
I love the WAC Casablanca always and forever, WAC forever.
Raja always and forever!
I will tell you the leader has gone. Libya has gone. We will see what you will do with those who took millions of dollars in the time of revolution. May God bring you tranquility, o Lord!
I am a student. I have a baccalaureate degree. But I am still confused about the itinerary to choose and scared about making a wrong choice in my studies.
Are there many prospects for students after the baccalaureate especially literature students?
God willing, God will grant us a relief!
I too, I don't know what to do after the baccalaureate. Maybe I will pass the bac and get married, lool! Sorry for this comment. Good luck for everyone!
Salam. Are prospects for SVT subjects like Physics?
Salam. My name is Sabrine. This year I will sit for the baccalaureate exam in S.V.T., God willing. My problem is that my height is 1.47m and I am 17. I don't know what to do later because all jobs require height. Please help me if you don't mind. Thank you.
I am a student. This year I will study in the first year of the baccalaureate. I chose the subject of mathematical sciences. I passed with a score of 16.40. Everyone says that mathematical sciences are a difficult subject. Do I continue in this subject or not?
Is there anything new? We want to do something in our life before we die may God forgive you!
God is the greatest!
Salam alikum. I will study this year in the baccalaureate and I will need your advice if possible. I would like to ask you about my subject field SVT and whether I can go back to study PC without any problems. Thank you. Please help me.
Peace, mercy and blessings of God be upon you. I am a young girl, 19. I married on October 29. I live in Belgium. I married in Morocco according to the traditions of God and His messenger. After one week of my marriage, I had many problems without causes. My husband told me to go back to your mother without a cause. I was single before marriage; I mean I had no problem of this kind. Afterwards, he would apologize. So I came back. After one week, on the day of Eid, we came happily to visit my mother in Anvers. Now he went to Morocco to divorce. I don't know what I did to him. I can't understand anything. I want my husband. He also loved me so much. Now it seems he was manipulating me. I understand nothing. Tell me what to do! Thank you!
Salam. I want to reconcile with my husband. I don't want to divorce. Can they help me? Thank you!
Salam. I married on 29/10. Two weeks after my marriage, he hates me without cause. Now he wants divorce without reason. Maybe he has returned to an old girlfriend. He deceived me. Someone did satanic acts and now he hates me. He used to love me to death. I married not to divorce. What can I do please?
I am 23. I am married but I will divorce. But now I am neither married nor divorced. I am at my parents' home. I am astonished because his sister is the cause of divorce even if there is no problem between us. What do you think?
Please, I want to chat with Rachid El Ouali, please, please!
Salam alikum. I divorced my wife. We had one child. She has married but she is still claiming the alimony. Can this alimony be dropped? Thank you!
Salam. Thank you for this topic which is very important because most people in Morocco talk about family law. They think it has just made things worse, it has increased conflicts and number of divorced women and street children. Yes, I agree with you. It is true that we are far away from Islam and look to the west only and imitate them. But worse than this, even if we have copied the family code from France, we were incapable of implementing in a society where corruption, favoritism and unemployment in all their forms are widely spread. I am not talking here just about family law, but also about all laws in general which unfortunately are mere ink on paper or are implemented only on the poor. These are my conclusions as a student of law. But unfortunately law is different from reality. Therefore, I call upon all competent sides to accelerate the elimination of favoritism and bribery before thinking of implementing any law because all laws are unfortunately borrowed from the west and we try to implement them in an environment which is not propitious.
Hi Rachid. How are you? I am Nawal from Italy. I am one of your best fans.
Salam Rachid. How are you? I am Fati from Essaouira. I like you so much because you're the best actor. You act roles as they are. I used to play theatre with youth in Rabat. My wish was to study acting and play with you even a secondary role. However, conditions aren't suitable. Forgive me, if I am long. I wish you a successful career, more success and a happy life. Bye!
Hi Rachid El Ouali! I am an actor. Thank you! I love you!
My husband stole my car after beating me in the streets. I am the owner of the car although he pays monthly installments. Do I have the right to take it back? I have summoned him for divorce because he hasn't been providing for two years for our two children. What are measures which can be adopted and how long does it take for a divorce case? Can I take back my car?
I am Halima, an Algerian woman. I don't wear the veil but this doesn't mean that I don't respect religion. There are many veiled women who do everything corrupt and make of the veil a weapon and evidence of piety. Therefore, the veil isn't a standard of respect. Do you agree with me?
Salam I'm Wafaa from Morocco. I love you all and inchallah Hamid and Hajar star. Bye. I love Hajar.
Very nice thank you.
I love Hajar so much because she represents my nice country. I wish you success in your artistic career and hope always to listen to songs of Morocco. Long live Morocco, Habib.
God bless you, you deserve it.
It is not easy to defeat Kadhafi and his cohorts. However, the problem is who will rule Libya. Will all forms of repression be eliminated or even with the death of Kadhafi will Libya remain the same?
Kadhafi is the Arab leader and commander of all. Everyone will regret his death. God, Moamer and Libya alone!
May God grant you happiness!
Of course, Souheil - if we don't do this, we're not Algerians! 1, 2, 3 long live Algeria! Algeria will go to the World Cup, God willing. Gooooooooooooo!
Salam alikum. I have a titled parcel of land. I want to build it. Can I take a Fogarim loan and what should I do? Thank you!
God is the Greatest. Chahata is dead, damaged. 1, 2, 3 viva Algeria! my love 3, 3, 3!
Stop lying to us!
Congratulations!
I am looking for a job in any field. I haven't completed my studies. I live harsh conditions. I have a diploma as fashion designer. My hobby is drawing fashion designs. Now I need a job. I have studied up to the fourth year of the lower secondary.
I would like to become a minister of transport in order to reduce the burden of unemployment.
Ladies and gentlemen, don't lose hope! Everything is in the hands of God. I am also looking for a job although I haven't completed my studies. I want a job. The important thing is that it be an honest job. I hope my brothers, you will help me find a job. I wish you good luck. Thank you!
I am a young man in the prime age. I am looking for a job, any job. I just want to work. I am tired of unemployment and strolling about on the streets. We don't have any conditions anymore. No matter what I will say about the nature of the job, I won't find it. Anyway, find some job of any kind.
First of all, I would like to offer my sincere thanks to the initiators of this programme which offers many job opportunities for young people. Best wishes of success in your endeavor and efforts for us.
Hi! I thank you for this interest in those who work with us. I thank you very much. I am a citizen who looks for a job but I found nothing!
I am looking for a job. I would like to work in anything and help my needy family.
I am a young man, 25. My favourite job is mechanic. I have 10 years experience in this field. However, I am fed up with working for others. No one respects my ideas and my professional powers because this is the situation in informal sector. I wish there was an association to teach us to train artisans in the country because artisans are lost while the unskilled are lucky in this life. Thank you!
The important thing it is a successful project, God willing. However, the state should take care the workforce, that is, whether they are trained or not. If we study the industrial zone (Ain Sbaa, Bernoussi from 1980 to 1998) we'll see that now they are all closed. This means all of Casablanca is unemployed, 5,000,000, stop thinking only of real estate and tourism. Take care of projects such as these which will profit society.
Ha ha! World No Tobacco Day! Let's remain quiet! If we talk, we will enter politics!
Salam alikum. Thank you for this religious channel.
Ok then clandestine immigration is something very bad and I want you to help Moroccans in order to fight this phenomenon.
There's nothing better than this country, but you really need to have papers. I'm in France.
I want to listen to the Friday recital of Qur'an (toulba). God bless you for this channel.
I am so sorry but you are really rats! The president didn't lie. Shame on you to ill-treat his corpse. Regardless of what he did, let the court decide and grant you your right. His soul has gone with our God. Why ill-treat the corpse? May God forgive you! By God you will see all evil from NATO and the French! You will see only torture and intervention in your rights.
The FAR team didn't play well during this championship.
No to Mawazine, no to corruption in Morocco!
There is no power and no will but from God. This is all I can say.
In the name of God, I thank all the citizens who contributed with their votes and I also thank the PJD party which who brought us great results 47 seats. I ask them not disappoint us in the coming years. I have a question which I want you please to answer: Do you have information about Hassan Anjar? Why did he leave the PJD in the city of Nador?
God is Great, even the ignorant become parliamentarians in Morocco, a shame! In my opinoion, people who can't write or read should leave their places for the competency but not the resources, I mean by resources: Money.
I want a topic about Moroccan women.
By God, you will regret the death of the leader on the day on which America and France will turn against you. Then regret won't help you.
Shame on them!
Congratulations to Libya for capturing the criminal Moamer Kadhafi. We are happy for you. Mhamd from Morocco.
What did Benkirane do so far?
Injustice!
Long live Algeria. Long live Maskiana.
Salam. Is there no news after the demise of the president? I was expecting to hear some news. Where are you who destroy yourselves with your own hands? May God rest the soul of Libya!
How can we communicate with this council? I wish to have a quick reply. Thank you!
I am a fan of cycling and I practice it.
May God heal everyone.

Hi I want to see the movies of the Andalib by Mouregane Ahmad Mouregane
Is it possible for rich people, I mean is it possible? I hope to have a reply. Thank you. I need money, my mother is sick.
To those who assaulted this girl, she might be better than all of you. Humans commit mistakes.
I love Hala Sarhane, you're shining on Rotana. Inchallah she'll always present the programme. The second thing is that I want to congratulate the great artist Asala Nasri, she truly deserves all the best. May God make you succeed in your life.
Salam alaikoum, blessed Ramadan.
Hi, please I want to watch the film 'Andalib Eldoki' Omar, Salma and Ayadono.

If you want Star Academy Maghreb to be successful, do like Lebanon star academy- some advice.
Hi Saad, I love you so much. With the will of God you will be the star.
Salam to all of you. I am Youssef from Morocco I hope to participate in the second edition of the Arab Maghreb star academy and hope not to disappoint all those who trust Cheb Manouz.
Maghreb star academy is nice but there is no audience and on the level. I hope to participate but I am very young, I am only 14.
I love you star academy and my friend Hajar, a kiss to Diaa, I love you Diaa, I am from Rabat and I also want to participate in the star. I want to go on a visit to Diaa in the star I am 14.
I am interested in the field of design. I have designs ready. I want some sites of fashion design schools in Morocco. Please help; thank you!
I want more photos.
I am Fatima from Morocco. I study dressmaking and modern design. I hope to keep on in this sector because I like it so much.
No matter where you go, you won't find anything like the Moroccan Kaftan. It shows style and authenticity.
There is no power and no will but from God the greatest.
Salam. I would like to know if this association exists in Rabat, where exactly and how to contact it.
Salam. Please let me know if there is an association in Rabat and where exactly?
I would like to join the association. Is that possible? Where is it?
I would like to join this association. Thank you!
OK guys, what can I tell you? This doesn't enrich young women, it just causes them problems such as poverty. This becomes a cause of divorce for many people.
For God we are and to God we shall return.
My sincere condolences to the families of the victims. Oh Lord rest their souls, oh most merciful, Lord of all the creatures, You are capable of answering prayers.
I like all of the participants and wish them success.
Salam alikoum. I hope that this will be a lesson for everyone.
Salam. I am Hanan. I wish success to everyone on Star Academy Morocco. I always wish to participate with you, but no luck. I wish you good luck everyone.

Nasro makes the heart weak.
Thank you Simo, I love you Nasro and love those who love you. Nasro and the heart is weakened.
"to God we belong and to him we shall return".
May God accept from you and us. Happy new year. Blessed Eid.
Salam alikum. I would like to travel to Libya. However, I have a visa problem. Why should I need a visa although I am part of the African Union? Honestly, this law implemented by Libya is not reasonable. We are supposed to be Muslims not its enemies.
The exam was easy. But I was intending to repeat the year, I haven't revised anything. However, when I sat for the exam, I was shocked because I was expecting it would be difficult. Anyway, God willing, next year I will do the impossible to get high scores! Ok, pray with me! Good luck everyone!
The exam in general wasn't very difficult, but time was short. Anyway, we hope the results will be good!
Salam. I am a girl from Morocco. I love a young man via the internet. He is from Palestine and lives in Jordan. We've loved each other for five years. We want to marry but we don't know the necessary steps. Please help us. We wish success for everyone.
The exam was the worst experience in my life. I advise young people like me: If you've studied well, go sit for the exam. If not, stay home; it is better for you! This servant who talks to you has brought 500 papers for cheating, uselessly, because I haven't understood. But we learn from mistakes.
I want, please, to know results of the baccalaureate exam via my email, ok?
I want to know my score on the exam.
Hajar forever.
This is great, by God.
Blessed Ramadan to everyone. Long live Zallabia of Aboufarik.
Hi. I love Zalabiya of Boufarik.
Long live Zlabiya and Cherbet of Boufarik.
Salam. I am a fan of Marouan Chamakh. I wish him good luck with the Moroccan national team. Moroccans need joy and Chamakh is the joy. We want more from you Chamakh!
My name is Nada from Fez. I wish eternal wellness to the player Marouane Chamakh. A very nice game. I hope you will always live in happiness, God willing.
He plays well only in France. But here in Morocco with the national team, he is concerned about his feet. Ok, may God bless Mostapha Hajji! As for those players who came after him, they don't perform well. To the girls who are flirting: he doesn't even know Arabic.
Thank you.
I want an education site.
Honestly, Morocco needs a revolution of the people without the king because the acts endured by the weak are unacceptable. I think that it is not Ramadan which make people irritated. It is rather their conditions of poverty and necessity. However, we don't know when officials will understand themselves and leave something for the people.
Hello! I wish you more success. Pop music make me feel better. It is heritage, art and singing!
Peace of God be upon you. We are Muslims, praise be to God, this shouldn't be done by Muslim women. We ask God to guide them. Thank you so much for this opportunity!
Salam alikum. If you want to govern, govern at home not govern the daughters of other people. These aren't Muslims.
When we hear this expression of personal freedoms which is claimed by some associations, we reiterate again our question: aren't we going to put an end to sexual harassment against men? As this seems for many people natural but in reality it touches our morals as a Muslim people. As we don't like to see our parents and sisters wearing revealing clothes, we have to fight this phenomenon of fashion, which is sapping the foundation of all societies which is morals.
Inchallah Tangier will host the international expo 2012 with the will of God. I ask everyone who loves Tangier to pray for Tangier. On Monday we'll see who is the winner inchallah oh God.
Long live "God, king, and country", the land of free people and source of light.
Inchallah Tangier will host the internatinal expo 2012 with the will of God. I ask everyone who loves Tangier to pray for Tangier and on Monday we'll see who is the winner inchallh Oh Lord.
We love sharia law.
O Lord support Islam and Muslims! I am proud to be Muslim. Praise be to God!
Salam alikum. I welcome this initiative of businesses because it reduces unemployment rates, encourages national initiative in development and contributes to human development. Therefore, I encourage this initiative and wish it success.
I am sorry for people who made of the month of fasting and night worshipping an opportunity for entertainment and smoking Narguila (which is banned!!) and travelling between music festivals!!! But, praise be to God, this is not the situation of all Tunisians. (Here I am sorry for the incredibility of those who wrote this article in presenting the whole reality!!! Because they have forgotten to mention people who fill mosques in Al Tarawih prayers who follow the example of the honourable prophet, peace and prayer of God be upon him. Glory be to God. How He guides some people and misguides others. I repeat my sorrow for the desolate who made of Ramadan an opportunity to spend nights in cafes and festivals. May God guide everyone. Peace, mercy and blessings of God be upon you.
Why have you arrested Wiydad and Raja?
I like this so much.
She cheated a lot, because this cannot be all intelligence.
I am proud of the existence of a girl like you in Morocco. I wish you a successful career in your personal and professional life. Wishes of success, God willing.
Hajar I love you so much and encourage you. I encourage you for claiming your right. Whether they want or not you are always a star in the eyes of all Moroccans and we're with you to the end. A big kiss to you.
Salam Hajar I love you.
Praise be to God in all cases!
Peace be upon all Muslims. I study literature. I don't know what to do. I am worried that if I go on studying literature, I'll find no prospects in future. I'm too worried to study economics because everyone I ask says it's difficult. If you have any information, please advise us! May God reward you with good! Please reply!
Salam. I want a reply please. I study arts and I am talented in drawing. Therefore, I can't find a school with a GPA less than 13. They don't accept a GPA of 10.5. What is the solution, please? Thank you for your understanding!
I am a student in the first year of the secondary. I study mechanics. But I don't know whether I will work in the future. I don't know the prospects for this subject, and I don't know whether I'll be successful. I hope you'll help me with information. May God reward you with good!
I'm a science student in in Fès. I love the technology branch of studies. I want advice on entering this branch. I'm brilliant in maths and physic. I'm weak in French. What should I do, my beloved ones? I don't have the money to enter private schools to study French. Please help me with advice!
I am a student from the city of Fkih Ben Saleh. I have a serious problem with teachers who don't do their job. This is why we have to take extra tutoring hours. Even politics have entered the field of education. This is why learning has deteriorated for students. We have to find a solution to this problem so that the level of students will be improved. Thank you!
Salam alikum. I am your brother Mohamed. I passed the bac 2010 in humanities. I don't know the prospects of this branch. I hope you can spare me any information. Thank you!
AIDS is a fatal disease and widely-spread. May God protect us and protect all Muslims.

Honestly, I would like to say that Kadhafi is stupid and that Libyans are more stupid than him!
A sensational social film
I am a daughter of Casablanca, a city in Morocco. I think this is very excellent. Keep it up forever. Agreement is good. Though I am from Morocco, I like so much Tunisia.
Hi everyone! I like all the songs of Saida Fikri especially because it stirs in us nostalgia in the hearts of Moroccans because in all her songs there is a meaning we experience in our life and society. I daily listen to her because I feel so good. I say to all those who listened to me through this comment to listen to her. Thank you! They are my favourite! Thank you!
Is it possible to have information about phosphate in Morocco?
I love the goldfinch of Morocco because our bird in Morocco is good especially the goldfinch of mountains because there are many birds, the environment there is good in addition to the variety of birds it lives with such as Walwa, Bouh, Hazzar, Hadad.
I am a Moroccan young man. I need help to set up a building, electricity, plumbing and painting business. I work proficiently.
Hi Fnair, you're great, by God you're great, oh how great is 'Lala mnana'. I have nothing to say. God bless you, always like this, I wish you success. Samia.
I love you Fnaire.
Salam alaikoum, Fnair group is the best group in the Arab Maghreb. I wish them success and more in their life. I hope that they will present more songs.

Fnair group is one of the best groups to whom we wish success always forever Fnair

Everything that restores consideration to our artists is good! we knew nothing about meghri. We thank you very much and good luck. Aziz from the desert.
Jalila Hassan Mahmoud and Younes, happy Eid al-Adha.
This person is old-fashioned and hypocrite. He does not honour us in Tunisia, the country of openness and where Islam exists. I am Muslim. What is his problem to bother with Tunisia? He says how in Tunisia they respect Christians and Jews?
kadecho is a hypocrite. Long live Tunisia, state of rights. No to conservatism.
Good luck Bigg and Bilal
I have a short comment, I say to all the fans of Bigg, that Bigg isn't his name, he's a very famous American rapper his name is b.i.g. and may be the notorious know him very well.
Bigg isn't a rapper, he's nothing. A rapping mama's boy hiding behind the micro "ros
Hajar, I am crazy for you. But I want you to exhilarate me. I also have a voice and want to participate. I want you to exhilarate me. Goodbye beauty.
I love you so much Hajar. I am very happy with your success. You make me crazy especially your album. It is great. I wish you success. Thank you.
Hi Hajar. I am Zahira from Algeria. I love you and die for you.

I am Soumia Danoune. I love you so much Magharebia and wish you all the success. Thank you.
All the programmes are good.
In reality I read some novels but haven't read anything like "Attempt to live". It is a very nice novel. I hope that all the world reads this excellent novel. A salutation to the late Mohamed Zafzaf. Thank you.
I want to know the details about how to get a loan from this association. Thank you!
Salam alikum. I live in the city of Settat where I find difficulties to set up a small business both in getting a license or finding a location in Hay Al Hassani. Therefore, I ask your help in my business for manufacturing iron parts for boring machines including arms, pistons and other parts for CAT, KOMATSU, JCB and other types. I also contribute to teaching and training students in mechanics how to weld all types of metal including iron, aluminum, access, wires, sticks, welding torches and how to cut iron. Thank you! I hope to find soon as solution to my question, God willing!
How are you? I am Mohamed from Meknes. I have the idea for a project. I want to know the steps to take to start a project.
I am a young man, 22, Moroccan. I have a diploma in hairdressing. I work in Madrid. I want to set up, with your help, projects in Morocco, my homeland. I have the diplomas of many of my needy friends and shops ready for work. I ask for your help.
I wish success to this programme.
I am Said. I am 28. I live in Italy. I have a project devoted to mozzarella cheese. Help me financially!
There is no other God but Allah, Mohamed is the messenger of God.
This dangerous criminal who depicted the most beloved creatures of God Who was sent by God as mercy to the worlds. All Muslims must follow him and everyone who witnesses that there is no other God but Allah and that Mohamed is the messenger of God. I say to my dear brothers, follow the way of our beloved Prophet and light of our hearts,though following his Sunnah and the Book of God. Be sure then that you will win. Don't let this malignant germ provoke you along with those who instigated him to depict the honest Prophet because America and Israel are the enemies of Islam. Follow the steps of our beloved Mohamed, peace and blessings of God be upon him and you will really win my brothers because victory is for Islam as God has promised us so and God does not fail in His promise. The verse is in Sourat Al Rum "The Byzantines have been defeated, in the nearest land. But they, after their defeat, will overcome, Within three to nine years. To Allah belongs the command before and after. And that day the believers will rejoice in the victory of Allah. He gives victory to whom He wills, and He is the Exalted in Might, the Merciful. [It is] the promise of Allah. Allah does not fail in His promise, but most of the people do not know." O brother of Islam, adhere to the way of our Messenger and you will win with the religion of God. Don't let the children of monkeys and pigs manipulate you. Salam alikum.
God is the greatest, God is the greatest! Praise be to God! God is the greatest, God is the greatest! God is the greatest! I bear witness that there is no other God but Allah and that Mohamed is the messenger of God.
There is no other God but Allah, Mohamed is the messenger of God.
The nicest voice in the world.
Hi Ilham. Rawaj is a huge project to start with.
Salam alaikoum politicians. I also say to terrorism: don't touch my country.
May God grant you success!
Good, thank you.
Reform things and Morocco will make great progress.
I think that this...government explains another method of governing Morocco but...Better this than nothing, anyway Mr Abbas knows what he did to Moroccans so he should try to stop making young people dislike him until we all leave and he remains alone in the country.
Salam. I am a Moroccan citizen. I am proud of the leadership of our great faithful king.
I am from Morocco. I like Algeria so much. I hope you will honour us and lift our heads high. We are all brothers. You have made us happy against Egyptians. God willing, you will defeat them in their country. This not new for the Algerian people.
I want to contribute to political topics.
Muslims among infidels are millions. I hope from God the greatest to appease my resentment.
I am a black Moroccan. I love Maryam.
Hi! They just want division in Tunisia. But very soon, Tunisia will become as it was and even better. It will certainly be good. May God solve it! Bye!
I want a file about drought in Morocco.
Long live Morocco the "the friendly country and land of adventure", long live our king, long live the united Maghreb...Mohamed 24 France.
Hi, how are you? can you please give more information, this is my msn thanks so much
Bin Laden is not a terrorist. Terrorism is Bush and Sharon of whom we heard nothing in the news.
I think that Moroccans are not associated with Bin Laden because they love to follow him in what they hear about him, they all love him.
I love Bin Laden because he has firm and high ideas.
Salam. I am Aziz. I want to marry a Moroccan girl.
Yes to opposing terrorism, but Osama isn't a terrorist- he is just concerned about the Islamic interest and he is right in that.
God's greetings to you Siham- I agree with you. I will sacrifice my father, mother and soul for you, messenger of God.
Salam alikum. I ask your honour to verify the number of days, points and money.
The problem of drugs is very serious.
Salam alikum. Drugs are a serious plight in society especially in Morocco. In order to fight this problem, my advice is to increase campaigns on radio, TV, papers and magazines in addition to dedicating programmes to this problem, its causes and ways to fight it by hosting officials in the debate. Thank you! Sara Elmouh.
I thank you for your perseverance and I accept your advice. However, I don't have the email, I apologize.
I'm Layla from Chaouen I love you so much Hamid and here in Chaouen we all love you so much and inchallah you'll be the star, I'm 5 years old.
Viva Tunisia!
I am a militant from Sidi Ifni. All the events were real. Everything which was committed by the security was very harmful. Unfortunately, our brothers were beating us. But why this injustice????...
Yes, hi. You who say that Ayman al-Zawahiri has reached the Arab Maghreb: is this a nightmare or are you mad? Do you think that Bush and behind him Arab presidents are easy? Bush knows what he is doing. Relax, Bush is in charge of them. Where is Zawahiri and where is Ben Laden? Everyone has gone and even Gaza has gone with them.
I thank all those who contributed to the revolution. Thank you Tunisia! I say that God waits but doesn't forget. Tyrannical presidents have taken what they deserve. God willing we will go ahead and forget the past of oppression, tyranny and injustice!
Where are men there are only jackals in this country, forgive me brothers, a greeting to nice men.
I am Algerian and love my country. There is no power in the world that can divide us. Long live Algeria forever. Thanks
Greetings of peace to you. Your master died as a martyr before your own eyes, he is Saddam Hussein may the mercy of God be upon him. Dont blame your bloody work on Maghrebis.
There should be an in-depth analysis of Morocco as there are secrets not known by many.
Moslim is the best rap singer in the Arab World without rival.
Hi Hajar, I'm Rajaa from Marrakech- one of your fans. I often ask for news about you because I love you and want to know what happened to you on the Star Academy Maghreb program, because I didn't see you on the tour.
To tell you the truth my brothers, rap is like water in my life. If I don't listen to it, I have a headache. My eyes become misty. Now I practise this hobby. I would like to say therefore that the best band is Fnaire. I am Sara from Casablanca. Pride to Fnaire.
I am a singer of what they call madness. I am the biggest producer of these songs, which are very bad.
Pray for me! I will sit for the baccalaureate this year. Do you think it will be easy? Oh Lord make it easy, oh Lord, amen!
I love you so much Hajar and Hamid, I'm Moroccan and I love you all but especially you.
Hi Hajar, I'm crazy for you, you're beautiful, God bless you, you have a nice voice, thank you.
Salam. My comment is the following. All rappers in Morocco are good. I say this because I heard them all. However, I prefer one because only a few people prefer him. I will tell you why, because when a person sits down to listen to rap, the first thing he hears is the rhythm. The second thing is the voice. But if you want to choose your best rapper, you must listen to the meaning born by the rap music. If you observe well, you will find Muslim the best rap singer. Try to listen to him sincerely and reply to me.
I would like to say to these people who do such things that God the Almighty says you don't guide those you want. It is God Who guides those who want.
We need real reforms beginning with the constitution to animal rights. Enough playing with election figures. We ask God safety for the country of the noble??? Salam alikum.
I can't understand why you are calling for change given that since the access of our king to the throne, he spared no effort. You couldn't even dream of huge projects he conducted including social housing, national initiative for human development, highway and other projects. Whenever he uncovers a manipulation by some side, he substitutes him. Just forget that absurdity. You can't find anyone like our king. Have you ever seen a king or even a president bowing to kiss the heads of the disabled and sick people? Or step down in the mud for the interest of citizens? Our king is a crown on our heads and he will always remain on top of our heads.
Salam. I am a girl. I am 22. In my opinion, you shouldn't judge underage girls without knowing them. I know a girl who is 16. She will get married very soon. God bless her, she is more mature than me. In my opinion, girls are currently very mature compared with girls in the past. I hope you want judge anyone before knowing him. There are young girls who want to live their adolescence and there are girls who want to marry at an early age. This depends on the conditions of the family. May God assist you. Every girl will see her fate. May God assist them. Bye.
There's no entertainment in Maghreb star academy like Lebanon star, there's nothing fascinating, Maghreb star is lagging behind. But Hajar is the star, 100 times better than Yosra.
My name is Yassine from Sidi Yayha. Long live M3
We want nothing of you. Those who have five jobs, they made it for him. The problem is with you big robbers. You should begin by yourselves and reduce your salaries and increase the salaries of ordinary people. A little from you, a little on us and everything will be fine. Morocco will never make any progress. We are governed by old people, they are only busy accumulating money. So how can they think of us? I will tell you a joke. A billionaire was offered the last model of Mercedes. He said I wished you would give me instead money and give me more money. A billionaire walks on his feet and his son on a bike. So how do you want us to be?
God willing, there will be all the good because our neighbours on top and below are all beaten. But we are progressing in every side. We can also say we are growing, we just need some patience and wisdom in criticism. Salam.
We will see what they will do. We are fed up with statements. We are fed up with useless promises!!!
Hi Nasro, you know I find discs on the internet, you should talk to them.
Hi Cheb Nasro I wish you success and God knows how much I love you
How are you? Never mind, there will be good God willing. I am also in the vocational training. Thank you. Bye.
This is not true.
Long live Morocco, Mr Zeitounne Rali, Oulad El Blad are working for themselves and for their country. Thank you.
I would like to become a professional. I am 13 from Morocco. I hope to participate in a team in Barcelona.
1.2.3 long live Algeria 1990.
Long live Algeria and blessed Ramadan.
I want to tell Moroccan young people that being rich isn't eternal, God exists who is eternal in this life. We must fight this phenomenon. I have participated in the baccalaureate with my own efforts and I am expecting to pass with the will of God.
Salam alikoum. Praise be to God. This year's exams were up to par for me. I didn't find any difficulty. I wish success to everyone, God willing.
What can I tell you my brothers, the ministry daughter of [expletive] makes girls pass more than boys, it saw that there is nowhere to recruit them, so it is making people fail in the exams.
Hi. I am a student in the second year of the baccalaureate. I am very sad because I repeated the year two times. This time I hope to God that I pass, Amen.
Bado Zaki.
Islam is the religion of covering and chastity. Cover yourself up women! This is better for you.
This is the will of God for His subjects. This is mercy from God, may God make it everlasting, amen!!!
I don't agree with these people who call themselves salafists because their acts are not suitable for Islam as a religion. Our tolerant religion promotes virtue and prevents vice. If I say prevents, I mean it prevents vice in a way that is best. The best evidence about this is the tradition of the prophet and his acts in fighting vices and obscenities. Therefore, I hope that these people look at their religion and raise the awareness of Muslim women and Muslim men in a way that satisfies God and in a way that is best not with violence because violence creates violence. Thank you!
Hi Mr El Faouri Abdlkrim. I don't agree with your idea because if a 14 year old girl marries, she would not have taken her rights. This means she has not spent her adolescence. This might affect her after marriage especially if her husband considers her like a maid at home, she can commit adultery and ultimately the family will be torn up. I am 19 and I still don't want to marry. May be you want to know why. I haven't yet found who is pious and respectful. You are also 26 which means you can marry but you cannot bear responsibility. You are not mature. Finally, being married is similar to being single. Everyone has his responsibility. In my opinion, there are some men who are married and still interested in girls in the age of their daughter. This is just an advice. We aren't up to the responsibility to build society constructively and preserve our religion. Blind imitation ruined us and we are still in this backwardness. Excuse me, this is just discussion, I don't generalize for all girls or boys. An interesting topic, Morocco.
How are you Jamal? I am Fayssal and Said Jahjah. Are you coming to sing with us in the Moroccan championship 2009 and train with us in Safi?
Please, we want solutions for eliminating illiteracy.
What is this solution, ignorant person?
I want a site dedicated to teaching writing and reading on the internet, if you don't mind.
Salam alikum. I would like to ask how to find a copy of my baccalaureate degree which I have lost. Thank you very much!
The thing I still can't understand is why some teachers come to the classroom and tell us their story of life in detail but when they make the lesson, they tease us. When the year ends, they tell us: "Go to study. As for me, my salary is secured and I get it."
This is the truth!
I want to say that I like Rachid El Ouali a lot. I hope to see him in a film because he has been absent for some time.
Salam. What is the rate of divorce in Morocco?
What are job prospects for students of physical sciences?
Salam alikum. I would like to marry a girl but I am scared that we won't understand each other. I just like to know in case we don't understand each other and we have no children, can I get rid of her?
This Mrs Skalli is the cause of corruption spread in the country with this new law.
I don't like Badr Rsioui because he is a traitor.
I am married in Italy. Is this marriage recognized in Morocco?
Salam. I married in 2008, praise be to God, I am working and need nothing. However, the lady I married is an orphan. I tried with the help of God to realise her wishes. But this lady left me like a dog. Now I sleep in the streets. She takes my money, beats me as well as her family. She says that I should work and bring her money. I have thought many times of committing suicide. Now I want to take measures so that this lady comes back home. But I know she won't come back. What are the measures to take in this case so that she returns to the marital house? Reply to my msn, thank you!
Hi. We like the series of Rachid El Wali in the programme 'Lala Laaroussa' (Mrs the bride).
I say to all Muslims in Morocco to implement the Islamic sharia. Peace, mercy and blessings of God be upon you.
Long live Algeria. We will qualify for the World Cup. 1, 2, 3 long live Algeria. 1, 2, 3.
Terrorist
I don't watch this show. However, I wish everyone success. My greetings to you.
All this is done by Masonry. But every time they blame Salafis. "They want to extinguish Allah's Light with their mouths, but Allah will not allow except that His Light should be perfected even though the disbelievers hate it".
I don't know what this Maghreb star academy is. Explain to me what it is!
I am from Morocco. I see that Nessma TV covers mainly Tunisia, Morocco and Algeria. As for Libya, it is excluded from Nessma. We would like to see actors and singers from that country in Nas Nessma show for example. May God guide you manager of the channel and consider our request because Nessma is slightly discriminatory! Nada from Agadir.
I love Hajar, Farah and Badro.
An unsuccessful show; you should do it like Star Academy Lebanon.
I want zaki to return to the Lions of Atlas
Salam alikum. I would like to work in a company in Tangier, if possible. I am 24. Thank you!
Salam. I am looking for a job as gardener.
He killed and he was killed; that's all about it. Be brothers o Libyans, may God protect you and honour you with Islam!
Salam. God helps His servant if the servant helps his brother like in the case of the unemployed.
Salam, I love Gnaoua to death.
Salam. All these are words. It is just imagination of people. He says that 1% will be employed and leave the sons of the people dream of working. There is just favouritism! So stop tricks!
I beg you please, since I was young, I have been working and studying at the same time. I couldn't stop working and studying. I haven't succeeded in my studies. However, I have studied up to the baccalaureate level. I have a degree in the French language and a degree in security. May God help me! I have young brothers, I don't want them to fail as well in their studies. I wish I had a job in order to help them.
My name is Ouiam. I am looking for a job. I hope to find a job because we live in harsh conditions. I want a job in anything. Thank you!
Congratulations, God has granted you victory over your enemies. We thank God for our dear king Mohamed VI, may God protect him for us!
Salam alikum. I wish to all Muslims health and recovery. I have on the side of my breast some cysts. Now I have them even on the left side. But I don't know what they are. I think I am also sick. I no longer sleep. I would like to know what I have whether it is that disease or not because from time to time my breast hurts me. Some people tell me it is a problem of hormones. But I want to understand what the symptoms of cancer are please.
Salam alikum my sisters in God. I would like to ask you if cancer causes swelling of the breast, a blister under the skin in the breast and a pain in the breast. Can you please reply? I am waiting for your reply as soon as possible.
Cancer is dangerous for the health of people.
I am a young girl, 24. I discovered that I have two tumours, one in my right breast and the second below my left armpit. I would like advice about specialised centres in order to have the necessary exams. Thank you!
I am sick and don't have money to buy medicines. Please help me!
Salam alikum. I am 22. I have leukemia. Praise be to God I courageously accepted that. Now I rely on God the Almighty although the disease is very dangerous. It destroys everything. I was studying and lost one year of studies. I was under treatment. I hope that there will be associations to help people and prepare them psychologically and materially. I call upon society to respect sick people because anyone who knows I am sick says poor girl, you have that horrible malign disease which should not be named and so on. I don't know why they don't call it by its name!
There is no other God but Allah, Mohamed is the messenger of God. My brothers, don't forget remembering God. As He has created the disease, He has created the treatment. I wish recovery to all patients. I pray for them to be patient and to keep faith.
Salam alikum. I hope from God the Almighty to heal everyone who suffers, grant them the patience of Ayoub/Job and make them strong to overcome their sufferings! My friends, rub olive oil as it was recommended by the messenger of God especially oil on which was read "Rokia verses". Every disease has a treatment. I wish from God success to all Muslims. Salam alikum.
Honestly, there is a big difference between the two shores' way of life. However, after the success of the adventure in the sea, then begins the adventure on the land which is more difficult. Only the door of illegitimate activity is opened widely to you. Therefore, think before you take any step you will regret soon. I speak out of experience.
God bless you Tunisian people!
I have applied and was accepted. However, I was unable to come.
I want to do the casting.
Salam. I am a university student. Congratulations to the successful students and happy holidays until next year, God willing.
Honestly, the program is not up to par. Is it conceivable that subjects of God be privatised, even in education? There are many programmes and little value in them. But there is no other God but Allah.
Peace, mercy and blessings of God be upon you! Can we ask questions on this site? Thank you!
I don't like Hajar, but Diaa, Asmaa, Hanaa and Amal are the most beautiful singers. By God Hajar is feigning, I met her in Marjane when I wanted to greet her she said 'sorry I am busy', which means that when she rose up to the rank of an artist she became arrogant.
We expect good results, God willing.
Salam. Were the results of the pilgrimage draw announced? Bye.
Leave, go away!
I thank you for this site. I support those who say that Arab traditions don't honour us as Muslims.
I don't want them to deduct points from Wydad because they trap it in order not to take the league, Arab and African championships.
The FAR team has some of the best players in the national league.
Those who will be the stars of star are hamid and hajar
Long live Algeria. Salam alikum. May God rest the souls of all those who died for the game including Zayed Nesre Dine, 28, in an accident. God willing, we hope that what happened in Blida in terms of refereeing won't be repeated in Egypt. But I am sure refereeing in Egypt will be worse as it was here. However, they will make us happy, God willing, and we will offer it to all those who died. OK, God willing, we will defeat Egypt. A draw 1-1 would be enough. God willing, there will be many fans. By God our team is very nice and people are good. By God on the day of the match I didn't know whether to cry for those who died, or express my joy for the goals, especially the third. It was really young and great.
Hicham the drama teacher, where has he gone, and Farid you contempt him you dislike him because he's Algerian
Salam alikum. We will defeat Egypt and qualify to the world cup God willing.
Happy Eid to everyone! Abderrazzak!
Salam. Ok, all respects to you! I want to join the football school. I am 16.
I love Lebanese Star Academy because it offers them everything even their comfort. But Star Academy Maghreb, no. Imagine that the students leave the academy Friday morning to go to the prime, it means that the prime is very far from them not like Lebanon star academy they have it downstairs. This is my comment I love Assma Basit, Diaa, Saad and Adnane. Bye.
Hi how are you, I wished to participate in Maghreb star academy.
I hope that this dream will come true and a guy like Mostafa participates.
Hi how are you? I am Zineb I love Nessma so much.
I am Moroccan and want to say to Egyptians, if Egypt is the mother of the world, Morocco is its father, meaning father of the world, hhhhh.
Salam to lovers of Tidjani.
Woe to you mean people. May God grant victory to Saif, God willing.
I love Dyaa so much and wish her good luck but Mrhan I hate her. Saad take care of Diaa because she is the kindest in that star academy.
I am a young girl, 22. I am pregnant in my fifth or sixth month. I haven't informed my mother yet. However, I am scared of her reaction. Please help me by giving me the addresses or phone number of associations in Tangier. Thank you!
I am a single mother. I have three children and I am pregnant with the fourth child in my ninth month. I myself do not know my origins. I was raped at an early age by people relatives of the family who has adopted me. Then I found myself abandoned at the age of 17. I was left to the streets including all its temptations, fear, humiliation and rape. I decided to keep my children and struggle for them and not abandon them prey to wolves and people who don't consider conditions. I educate them and treat them nicely regardless of all the cruelty of the prejudices of people and their look. I will keep on struggling with the help of God. My eldest child is 15 and the youngest is 6. They are well-educated and brilliant at school. I don't care about the gossip of people except those who help me. As for those who undermine my morale, I just laugh at them. With my children, I have known love. Love of the self and love of the people. As I always say, may God sanction me in this life before the afterlife! I would rather be punished here than there. To say the truth, I live well thanks to my children whom I didn't kill or abandon. No matter how my morale has suffered, it is relieved when I see them growing up in front of me. Some would say, if you make a mistake, you fall one time not 2 or 4. What you don't know is that there are single mothers who have more kids. May God help them! We can't change what has happened, it is responsibility, it is fate. There is hope in God. But don't give in, don't abandon your children, falsify their names or kill them! Days and years pass by, many things change in our life. However, conscience is always living. Of course if you think today to abandon them, tomorrow you will regret it. I thank everyone who helped a weak person regardless of his/her situation. May God reward you with all the good!
I want, please, the address of an association that fights violence against women in Marrakech.
Salam. I am Moroccan and as we are with the Sahraoui people in self-determination I ask our Moroccan brothers to be realistic. Sahara is not Moroccan but Western. This is reality.
Hi my brothers. Honestly, we have a troubled psychology during the exams because of the control. What I want, may God protect you, is a site for the baccalaureate results. Thank you.
May God protect us, this is all. Say amen.
I am Abdellah. I love you so much Nasro. I love you. I love you. I sing sentimental Rai music. I like so much Nasro. Long live Nasro forever. God granted you a place in my heart. Nasro forever.
My brother Nasro take care of yourself and take care of your daughter Fatima. My greetings to her. Ok, I love you so much Nasro and love little Fatima to death.
Nashro, good Ramadan. Wish you a good fast God willing. My brother Nasro, I love you so much.
Die for you.
Brother Nasro, you are the best of the best, may those who died rest in peace. "Oh woman", "they took her in front of my eyes", "My night is suffering", "don't ask me", "Look what love did to me" etc. without mentioning other melodies, very nice melodies of king number 1 Nasro. I am 22, I began listening to Nasro since I was 9. God willing you will come back to the country and we will be together God willing. Take care of your daughter Fatima. May God protect her and you my brother Nasro. Nasro the best of the best.
OKKKKKKKKKKKKKK
You Libyans are rats. Kadhafi is the man.
Hi! By God you have talent!
Peace of God be upon you.
Radi is a thief.
We hope the situation will improve in Libya!
Hi, I love Yosra and Soraya the most beautiful inchallah you'll be the star and I vote to both of you I like so much 1 3 Bye
I hope Hamid will take the star, Chaouen
Hi to all the candidates of the Maghreb. God bless you all. I would like to send my greetings to Hajar. I like you a lot and I want you to try harder so that you can be the Star. Say hi to all the students, hi to Hamid and Morad I like them a lot. Good luck!
Salam Ahmed, I greet you warmly. I love you and I like you and Hajar, I wish you success, my greetings to Hajar and all the candidates, from Hafida Mona Rich Errachidia, good luck.
I vote for Hajar
I'm from Chaouen and hope that Hamid will be the star
Doesn't reflect the level of Raja.
Appearances can be deceiving.
Zaki forever, Lemerre is an unsuccessful coach as you saw against Gabon, it was chaos on the pitch. They kept turning on the pitch quite lost like parrots, only two or three players. Thank you.
Greetings to Bado Zaki. Long live Zaki.
Hi everyone. I wish you success in everything you wish God willing.
I study in the baccalaureate. I hope to pass God willing, oh Lord! I hope everyone will pass, oh Lord! God won't disappoint anyone, everyone will pass this year God willing, everyone who wishes to pass will pass, ok, one will reach his destiny decided by God. Passing!
Salam everyone. I study in the second year of the baccalaureate. Honestly, I am very scared. Whenever I think about the exam, I become irritable. I wish success to everyone, oh Lord!
All I wish is success for all students. Honestly, I suggest they present samples of the exam and advice so that we'll have an idea. I wish success to all students. I am in the first year of the baccalaureate. Thank you!
God willing, we too will sit for the exam. God willing, everything will be as fine as anyone could wish. I wish success to everyone.
Everyone will fail this year!
Peace and mercy be upon you. I am from Madrid. I love the Moroccan national team. I hope that you bring professional players in Europe so that we will qualify to the African Cup and World Cup, God willing. You should bring Soufiane Alloudi. Thank you. I love Morocco. I am a Rifain from El Houceima.
I love the national team to madness. However, take away the bastards who removed Zaki. Zaki is the son of our country and wants our good. Zaki forever. Zaki forever. Zaki forever. Zaki my darling.
The Sahara ruined us. We must have a team to say Sahara is Moroccan. I have a sportmanship spirit.
I love Badou Zaki. He is the best coach in Morocco.
Bado Zaki, where are you Zaki? Are we going to keep on shouting? Don't you hear us? It is as if we are dreaming and we are suffocated, we shout but no one hears or like someone who shouts in a long and big pipe. There is one thing, we Moroccans don't forget what Zaki did for us in 2004. He lifted the flag of Morocco. We can never forget you. Long life Zaki.
We want no one but Zaki. He is Moroccan football.
Hi my family in Morocco, all my country and Badou Zaki. I want to explain something. In the last game against Gabon, Roger Lemerre did nothing. There was a chaos on the pitch. Our players were lost, turning around on the pitch. But officials are lying to us. But now we know what they did. We sue to God everyone who wants to destroy the national team...s
I am a Muslim woman from Tunisia. I would like to join my voice with all those who are jealous for our tolerant just religion and against the denigration of our master, beloved and light of our hearts Mohammed, peace and blessings of God be upon him. I say to all those whose sick souls made them dare insult our noble prophet and tarnish his pure sacred image: "a thousand curses on you"!
I love you so much Rabie. You're very handsome in TV. But in reality you are fascinating, great. Take care of yourself. I hope you remember me.
Hi, how are you? I love so much Rabie Kati. I wish him greater success more than ever. All Moroccans are mad for you my brother Rabie. This is Hanane from Rabat. Thank you very much. Bye.
Salam. I am Loubna from Marrakesh. I am very happy to write this comment because I love Rabie. He is the knight of my dreams. I like all his roles. I wish him success in his professional and personal life. I hope you will reply to my email, please, I love you so much.
Salam. I wrote a comment yesterday about my favourite artist Rabie El Kati but I didn't find it posted. I love you Rabie.
Hi, how are you? This is Hanane from Rabat. Waw Rabie, the kindest and nicest person I know in this life. I wish you a good career and success at the world level. I love you so much from all my heart. Your friend Hanane from Rabat. I defy anyone who says about Rabie any unsuitable word because there is no one like Rabie in Morocco. I don't say these words because I am acquainted with him. I say this as a Moroccan citizen. Then I know Rabie. Rabie is a real friend. Well-done Rabie. May God assist you. Waw, I love you Rabie Kati and wish you a good career.
I am from Morocco!
Salam. Are you engaged?
Salam Basma. I liked you and I always listen to you.
I love Amr Diab and I don't believe that he will come. Mehdi from meknes 072 62 72 65
Thank you very much for these great recipes! Moroccan cuisine certainly has many delicious dishes that are found nowhere else. Thank you once more! I'm waiting for anything new!
I love Amr Diab so much. I am from Morocco. Waw, it is nice.
I hope that Amr Diab comes. I am one of his fans. For me he is the top Arab. He has great songs and every album is different from the last. This is real novelty. I hope that he comes to Morocco.
By God, Mawazine is very nice. I hope from God that I will be accepted as a candidate oh Lord. Amen.
Wow are you aware of what you said? Nancy and Amr Diab will come to Mawazine, cool. Of course I will come, I ask God that what you said is true, Nancy, Amr Diab and Fnaire wow...Thank you Mawazine.
This is not a good site you have to re-do it as it isn't good ok bye
Thanks for welcoming us and thanks for King Mohammed VI for his candor towards the victims of this disaster that killed ordinary people.
It's not a complete topic
In fact they deserve much more, poor people because of poverty and life conditions
Education programmes in Morocco are all imported that's why they are a failure they don't take into consideration the cultural, social and even economic environment of the Moroccan society.
I am a Berber girl. I live in Tangier. I love so much Amazigh songs because their words have nice and realistic meanings which we live in our life. There are for example songs about love such as the one sung by Youba. I am one of the fans of Youba. I encourage him, I hope that he continues his artistic career.
Congratulation for everything Antar Yahia and the sister of Karim Ziani!
The freedom of the individual stops at the freedom of others. The Muslim must lower his gaze. Therefore, this young girl has exceeded her freedom when she didn't respect the freedom of others. May God guide her, God willing!
I would like to work with Bin Laden.
Salam. I want to say this programme is nice. Thank you.
I am Hassan from Midekt. I hope there will be transparency and credibility in correcting exams.
In fact all cities deserve this achievement Tangier has a history, Tangier will host this exposition because people like it, the people of Tangier should repsect the Maghreb and foreign visitors, long live Tangier, inchallah we'll win
Thank you for this great comment.
You're an apostate Charfi, repent to God before the day when neither money or sons will be of any good except those who come to God with a safe heart.
Good reading Arfaoui Jamal.
I'm angry with the national team in the African Cup of Nations.
This is humiliation! Some take money and others are beaten with batons.
O Lord this is enormous!
I wish you a happy life and success. I wish you success in religion. Thank God. May God protect you. Ilyes from Rabat, 20.
It's true that Moroccans are known for their intelligence, but the majority use it only in idle matters. The cause could be the high rate of unemployment. This leads students not to care about studies. I think that if the state gets moving and provides jobs to graduates, it's certain that all students will work hard or will at least know their destination and why they're studying. Studies aren't just education, learning and culture; they're also a living which people are looking for. I wish success to everyone in everything that satisfies God. Salam.
May God bring about some good consequences for this country!
Marriage at a young age is not adequate for a young girl. She can be at the age of adolescence and not know the right person for her.
Wow, Hajar is a woman. People don't even dream of going on this tour without Hajar, if Yossra comes and sings the songs that Hajar used to sing, we'll throw tomatoes at her! Moreover, we don't acknowledge that hypocrite Hamid and the indecent Farah and Kawtar.
Long live Andalusian music!
Only those in trouble feel the hardship. Just say may God assist bac candidates.
Why are the animals endangered? Please, a new topic. Thank you my brother. Thank you very much.
Peace be upon the followers of the right path. O Lord support your Moujahidin servants in all parts of the world! Victory is for you followers of Droukdel, victory is for you! God the Almighty says "if you support Allah, He will support you."
Morocco isn't in its level as it's weak
Ok if we want our country to be nice.
He is dead.
I like it.
I am categorically against violence.
I live in Douar Maaza. I want to say many things but I will talk about all poor people in Morocco. Many young people are lost. Many young people follow the way of addiction. Many young people want help. Resources are not available. Now it is the Eid. There are people who don't have money for the Eid. Is this not enormous against the Moroccan citizen?
This is injustice, this is injustice!
What do you want of us? What you did to us is enough. You have gone too far. May God support our king Mohamed VI. As for the rest, they are mere robbers!
There is nothing in our Jazayer (Algeria). May God burn terrorism.
Salam alikum. Is there any work in Morocco in the factories in El Kheraba?
Thank you very much!
God bless you Migri brothers for your everlasting songs
Salam alikum. First of all, I thank you very much because you think of your heritage and traditions and want to reach the summit. May God reward you in your endeavours. I wish you success in your artistic fate. Thank you! I love you Moroccan Caftan.
I like fashion shows.
Thank you very much for this site! It is great!
I don't like any of them.
Salam alikum. This is great. I can't describe to you how beautiful this is. I was a designer. However, I wasn't lucky. Moroccan Caftan is very nice.
Honestly, I am one of the fans of the traditional dress. Therefore, I would like to join you. I want you to offer me help if possible about this field so as to enhance my skills in it. Sincerely yours.
By God, they have no shame. There is no other God but Allah. Jews don't know what awaits them. There is no power and no will but from God. O Umma of the messenger.
Peace and blessings of God be upon our master Mohammed with whom problems are solved, distresses are relieved, goals are achieved, aspirations are realised and clouds are irrigated with his noble face. Peace and blessings be upon him, his family and companions in every glimpse and breath in the number of everything He has created.
You have looted the country and people, they are billions.
If we want to create additional job opportunities, we have to increase salaries in order to boost the purchasing power. In this way, this will boost the economy and demand. Then you will see factories opening their doors and investors coming to Morocco.
"But ye shall not will except as Allah wills,- the Cherisher of the Worlds." May God grant us patience, o Lord!
Ittihad til death, against the will of everyone.
Wydad forever.
I want to know how you deal with loan applicants. When will they repay their loans and what are necessary criteria to grant loans?
In the name of God the Beneficent the Merciful. I ask your respectable honour to grant me a loan to set up project of buying agricultural equipment. I hope you will accept my request. I wish you health and wellness.
I have the idea of setting up a project of aluminium in addition to the wood work workshop in which I work now because I get orders in this sector. How ever I don't have necessary resources. Is it possible to offer an assistance of 40000 dirhams? Thank you.
Salam alikum. I am a Moroccan young man. I am 25. I am an immigrant in Italy. I want to set up a project in my dear country. Is it possible to help me?
Hi. I want to restore a Casbah in the region of Taroudant. It is four stories. I want to invest in a touristic project. How can Moukawalati help me in this sector and what are the necessary conditions? Thank you.
There is no power and no will but from God.
I am a 24 year old young man. I live in the region of the town of Tafraoute near Tiznit. I have a project in my region. Can you help me because this town needs such projects to develop? Thank you.
I condemn this attack. However, where are Muslims?
"Indeed, Allah confers blessing upon the Prophet, and His angels [ask Him to do so]. O you who have believed, ask [ Allah to confer] blessing upon him and ask [ Allah to grant him] peace." O Lord attack Jews as they have denigrated our noble messenger.
We have to respect God the greatest, God is the greatest, save us in Morocco!
We have stand on our feet and watch some film so that God knows we are Muslims.
O God, o God, what is this evil? We have to show we are Muslims. God is sufficient for us and He is the best disposer of affairs.
Hi I'm Imane from Morocco I encourage star academy even if it isn't that good and some people are arrogant and have to be removed from that place
Rai for me is Maghreb culture, so long live rai, with its Mami, its Khaled and its Said Mouskir. An homage to Hassni and Bilal the prisoner.
What does a human wish in this life? It is happiness. Happiness is to be faithful to your God, not oppressing his creatures and have a good end. Therefore, the end is the most important and work in order to deserve this end, expected from God the Almighty.
I love Cheb Mami so much even if he's in prison because my voice is like his, my friends who heard me say that I'm second Cheb Mami, thanks to all.
"When Allah's succour and the triumph come. And you see mankind entering the religion of Allah in troops, then hymn the praises of thy Lord, and seek forgiveness of Him. Lo! He is ever ready to show mercy. " These are the right words. Peace and greetings on him. May He who has created you have mercy on all of you, all the followers of Mohamed and Hassan who are the same, faithful (unclear). Or it is no longer Molay Ali or Chrif. Ali Bounoua.
Salam. Stop Morocco needs a lot of work.
I seek refuge with God. There is no power and no will but from God the most merciful and most beneficent. The fate of these disbelievers is to hell, God willing. We are Muslims. Our religion is Islam. Therefore, we shouldn't see such thing or even talk about this issue as it is considered a challenge of God and a challenge of our master Mohamed, peace and blessings of God be upon him.
Hi. I wish you a successful career.
Morocco forever. Morocco will win by force ok. This is all I have to say. Bye.
This article is very great.
There is no other God but Allah, Mohammed is the messenger of God. God's curse on those who denigrated the prophet.
Death to anyone who denigrates our prophet Mohamed!
By God Algerians you don't deserve this victory! By God, you have brought shame to the Arab Maghreb shame on you!
Long live the Maghreb union Lol
Salam alikum. My husband chose the option of voluntary retirement from work and left us. He no longer gives us a pension. I have two daughters who are still under my guardianship. I am not a working woman. I have no resources to provide for these two girls. I don't know where he is. Please give me a solution! I have serious problems.
Great this is wonderful!
Salam alikoum. We're sorry, ashamed, and resort to God from the evils of our deeds. You've left all rights, the right to a living, the right to work, the right to health and education and you go to defend the baseness that is terrifying. We had enough moral depravity and imitation of the west and adopting their evils. If I were you I would have ordered the harshest punishment or drop these homosexuals in the depth of the sea so be ashamed of yourself and fear God or go to another country, this is not your earth.
The club of Kenitra called helala did something great this year. We ask the fans of the city of Kenitra to attend intensively because the KAC needs support. On behalf of the fans of KAC. Congratulations to the FAR.
I encourage the existence of a lot youth clubs.
I am a Moroccan young woman. I have a problem. I want people who have help to offer it to me. A Moroccan man wants to marry me. He has another wife with whom he has spent 8 years. He wants to divorce her. She can't have babies. But she doesn't want to divorce. What can we do? I hope you will help me.
Hi, how are you? My name is Maria. I love music.
KAC, forever and ever.
I'm Smail from Agadir. I like doves; in fact this is my favourite hobby. I hope from the people who have doves to take care of them. I wish success to everyone who has this hobby.
I love the doves, they're the best hobby, and if anyone has doves, he should take care of them.
I have been married for 3 years. My husband works abroad. He doesn't provide for me and doesn't want to assume his responsibility.
Peace, mercy and blessings of God be upon you. I am inquiring the number of days I have received this year. Thank you.
Please help me by providing me the name of a centre for the rehabilitation of drug addicts. I have a relative who is addicted to "majoune" and "lkala". We don't know how to help him. Please, the situation of the family is very challenging psychologically and so is the state of the patient. May God reward you with all the good!
I would like to have real information about drugs.
I want to know the number of points I have in the CNSS.
Wake up Arabs from your sleep and stop these fancies and gossip like old maids, this is what brought us to the lowest ranks.
God curse you ok
First of all, parliament should be removed. Secondly, corruption, if these three are removed, Morocco will be nice. May God grant success to all!
Happy new year to all Amazigh people.
Salam alikum. What is the rule of a married man whose mistress fell pregnant who wants to marry her and recognize the baby? Is he punished by law? How? I hope you will clarify this issue. Thank you!
Thanks to everyone, we just want peace and to live with dignity in our country. Long live the king.
Farah, you're a star.
The site is very interesting because it presents important issues, especially the topic of women, since women are half of society. Thank you. I hope you will accept my comment.
I am proud of everything done by Moroccans and our culture is rich. I don't allow anyone to accuse Moroccans of not showing concern to the best prophet, peace and prayer of God upon him. We are Muslims before being Moroccan. We are proud of being Moroccan and if you aren't happy, commit suicide.
There is no other God but Allah, we are at your service messenger of God!
Excuse me, poverty and misery make you do anything. May God adjust things. Before reforming Morocco his country, he must reform his administration and people who steal funds of our people.
salam this is Said the best channel is r.................
Praise be to God, everything went well but the text they gave us in Arabic and we haven't reached it, even the programme we haven't completed it. In my opinion, before they implement measures and that control, they should first see whether the students have completed the programme and understood it first. I wish from all my heart good luck to everyone, Ima from Tetouan.
Tamazight exists, whether they want it or not.
Salam Alaikoum, I hope from the Riyadia channel to broadcast the game of Chabab Rif and Raja Casablancais.
I love rap music.
I like hip hop and thank H-Kayne, Bigg, Fnaire... I ask everyone concerned to help us in order to become like them. Thank you for the opportunity to express our opinions freely.
Oh Lord success.
Salam alikoum. I didn't pass the baccalaureate exam but I will sit for the second session. I hope that God grants success to me and everyone who will sit for the second session like me. I was wondering whether you can help me. I want the answers of the exam in which I was not successful. I hope to God that you will help me as soon as possible because time is passing quickly and I want to catch up. Please help me.
Salam alaikoum. I think that the exam was reasonable but not for all the subjects. English for example was a little complicated in comparison to the other subjects. The easiest subjects were history and geography. I wish success to all the brothers now that the results have been announced. I will sit for the second session because my grade in the regional exam was a bit low. Salam.
I want to know when will the results be announced on which site plz.
Salam. How are you? I wish success to all Moroccans.
Greetings to the fans of Nasro, yes Nasro who has beaten all records with his voice and his words, the best of all his songs are: Oh woman this isn't love, this is suffering, go and tell her to wait for me, oppressing days, there's no trust, I have over 140 albums.
I would like the player Jawad Zairi and Badou Zaki to be part of the national team and all the national team A.
I love the music of cheb nasro I wished to marry you my love
I hope the Moroccan national team will win over the national team of Algeria, God willing!
I am Ayoub from Khemisset. I hope Raja will reach the final of the African Champions Cup League, God willing. I am sorry for the performance of Wydad in Lubumbashi. I promise you Wydad will win the CAF cup. I hope Khemisset will rise to the first league.
I like your songs a lot, I swear to God, and I am a fan of yours because you have great songs that I love and thank you for always being the best singer.
I love the national team. I hope the days of Zairi, Hajji and Fohami in 2004 will come back without forgetting the big lion Badou Zaki. Morocco forever! God, the nation and king forever!
Always Nasrou or we lose. There's no one else in rai- he's the father of rai. I like nasrou and wish from the bottom of my heart that he would organise a concert in Morocco.
nasro you're always the first and will always remain the first inchallah I'm a Moroccan young man and like listening to you daily you're the king of sentimental rai
I love the national team as much as I love my mother. I hope from God we will win the African Cup this year.
Zaki forever till death!
I'm Moroccan this is good this is very good long live the King
In the name of God. Honestly, 2M channel is nice. However, they have to consider please presenting some Moroccan movies.
Blessed Ramadan.
Salam alikum, what remains on our channel is a pity for you.
Honestly, it is Egypt that began it all, and the first side that begins is the oppressor.
There is no power and no will but from God.
Salam alaikoum. I'm asking people about the contribution of Morocco in World War II, thank you.
May God enhance true brotherhood among Maghreb peoples, amen.
Thank you and may God reward you with good.
Salam alaikoum, may God grant you long life, you're the master of masters Ammar Ezzahi, I'm one of your best fans cheikh, may God grant you long life and sing in my wedding. You're a 1 choice artist, the master of the Algerian popular music...I have a heart which, after you, doesn't love anyone else to think of...Smail.
Peace of God be upon you my brothers. I have a divorce from discord. I have one daughter. The court ordered me a high price. I appealed the ruling. After the appeal, the court confirmed the first ruling. By the way, I have lost my job. So from where can I provide for my daughter in this condition with one thousand and one hundred dirhams? I am also married to another woman. I have another daughter and I am unemployed. Thank you.
I'm Amine I love Siham.
I'm a fan of Asseham group, I wish them success in their work...
Nass Lghiwan were something great at the beginning, they feared nothing and were talking about the real society where we live…but now???
Hi, I'm Siham from Taroudant, honestly I greet Nass El Ghiwane and wish them a long career with these happy generations, inchallah oh Lord.
Salam. I am a young man, 29. I married 8 months ago. I was joking with my wife and she was angry. So she went home. What does the law say about this? By the way, I am a respectable young man and I worship God. I am not addicted to any kind of drugs. Thank you!
I have been married for ten years. My husband cheats on me and I want to divorce. He says that I should go and divorce on my own. So what should I do? Please help me! Thank you!
My name is Islam. I married nine months ago. My wife left to her parent's four months ago. Whenever I talk to her in order to come back home, she says talk to my father. The problem is that she doesn't want to live with my mother. Now my mother gave me an independent house. However, my mother lives on the first floor. She is sick. I can't let her down. Now I have sued her in order to come back home. But in case she doesn't come back, what does the law say about this? Can I marry another woman without her consent? Please reply to my MSN.
Salam. My name is Mourad. I married in May. My wife was working in a studio. After marriage, she asked me to let her go back to work. As a conservative individual, I didn't accept. She asked for divorce. If I divorce her, how much could be the amount ordered by the court as her alimony?
Is divorce over discord legitimate or not?
I am divorced and have one child without marriage. I don't have the right to marry. Everyone humiliates me and I am patient. It is a mistake, I agree with all of you. We are lost. God is great.
From God we are and to God shall we return!
Hi Rachid. I liked your films for a long time. By God, you're a good actor.
Rachid El Ouali is very good you must come to haje.
Honestly, I like so much Rachid El Ouali. I always follow him. Thank you Rachid El Ouali. You are lifting the flag of the country in cinema.
I love you because you are big-headed.
I liked the serial "Al Mostadafoune" of Rachid El Ouali.
O guys, don't deceive yourselves! Hijab is a duty. It is not a Sunnah and not every woman is free. No! Hijab is a duty. Read Sourat Annissae!
I love Majid because he is an incomparable person in terms of morals. I love him to death.
Salam. I have one question: What is the required grade point average in the baccalaureate to access the school of medicine.
I love Ahmad and Hajar. I wish them success in their artistic career.
By God, I encourage Hajar.
What happened is caused by the state.
I like it very much.
Long live my country Algeria. We are all with you. Don't worry, with you Greens you'll do something great. Long live my country. I love you my country. We all love you.
Salam. I am Abdelali Kouiyf, I am a runner in the Mzabe athletics association. I wish to fulfil my dreams like you Hicham. Can you give me an advice please? I wish you good health and wellness.
I am Abdlmjid, athlete in 1500m. Thank you Hicham, Club Amal Sud Safi.
My name is Aabir from the city of Marrakech. These are difficult questions.
Ruin to the criminal!
God's peace on all of you. My name is Khalid. I am 20. I am fond of athletics. My dream is to become one day a holder of the national flag but I need help.
Salam alikum. Algeria is nice and its people are good. God willing, long live Algeria and its people free, free because colonization is over.
I am Laila from Casablanca. I want to say about Marwan Chamakh is that he is the best Moroccan player. I hope that he reads this. I hope to meet him one day, oh Lord. I congratulate him for his efforts for Bordeaux team which he always helps to win. Thank you Marwan.
The death of Kadhafi is unacceptable. He is a human being.
May God heal you all, oh Lord. You have to be patient. God willing, everything will be OK, God is great. Praise be to God.
Salam alikum. I ask God the Almighty to heal all Muslims of this cursed disease.
I've been using contraceptive pills for 10 years. Are there any risks?
My mother has breast cancer. I am very scared - even more than her. I advise every sick person to praise and thank God, who has recovery in His hands.
I wish you all a quick recovery.
Congratulations to our king Mohamed VI for the new born Lalla Khaidja who is as beautiful as her mother Lalla Salma and our king
I like to produce rap rhythms.
Salam. I am a young girl, 20 years old. I have a diploma and have been looking for a job for a long time but in vain. If possible, help young people in the country. We are all enduring. Thank you.
Salam. I am Chaimae, Moroccan. I sat for the baccalaureate exams and now I am waiting for the results. Pray with me to hear good news. Praise be to God I relied on God the Almighty and then on myself. May God make us hear good news I and the brothers who took the exam, amen but Moroccans are dangerous they can buy and sell you. May God take revenge.
Salam alikoum. In the beginning, I would like to present my sincere thanks for everyone who worked hard for setting up this site to express the opinions and observations of the students. Honestly, everything which was written by the students is a reality because what is the problem, the problem is that the ministry has put many lessons but the time wasn't enough for our teachers to explain all the lessons especially in the main subjects such as philosophy…This was a hurdle for us. Finally I ask God that the passing rate be high and that the passing grade point average be around 9.50. I wish success to everyone. Thank you.
Salam, enough void politics. All the people have uncovered this. Moreover, Mohammed VI, may God assist him, is just embarrassed from the enemies surrounding him. The people can cause trouble. Enough lies to the people! When you offer jobs for the poor, you increase the price of flour and oil. He always has to pay taxes no matter what he does. God exists! No one will win but Allah. Fear God, maybe you will be successful, God says the truth.
Peace, mercy and blessings of God be upon you. I would like to set up a small business in the field of ready-made clothes. I don't have any resources for this business. Therefore, I hope you will help me as much as you can. Thank you! Please reply! Thank you!
I want a job in driving b.
Salam. Aren't you ashamed to deceive people?
Salam. I am a woman. I want to work in order to provide for my children. Thank you!
I am a Moroccan young man. I am looking for a job in the field of agriculture.
I am Hamza from the city of Mohammadia with the wife of Jaouhari. Ok, thank you. Wydad forever. Good luck.
Long live Bado Zaki!
O Lord this is enormous! Is anyone who is concerned about the sanctities of Islam an extremist? We are a Muslim Umma and everyone must respect the freedom of the other.
The love of Gnawa is in the blood. I'm a guitarist in the group Zorona.
Local elections are a competition between big parties in Algeria, but the only obstacle of these elections is the Algerian people who always refuse to participate...
Salam. What about those who work on a daily basis? Do they deserve this aid or aren't they Moroccan?
Machallah, all Arabs know how to speak well, Moroccans and Algerians, if we were Muslims and believers, we wouldn't have spoken in this way. May God guide us all. We don't want help, we want you to take care of your country, that's all. Thank you.
They were living comfortably, to what situation have they dropped themselves! They were respectable!
Oh my God!
May God guide you!
Hi. Honestly, I liked this article. I hope that you send me the article about the conference of Tangier.
Star Academy is improving and I hope it is aired on Moroccan TV!
God willing, on to the World Cup, oh Lord, and we'll all be happy, despite those who don't appreciate Algerians and hate us.
Great site! Bravo!
I study Arabic alone in the book. I will learn Arabic very well.
This is great. However, you have to find solutions so that we will get rid of garbage and make Morocco the best country. I hope that my town - Tifelt- would be the first to be clean. I am the chairwoman of Information and Communication club. Thank you very muuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuch!!!! Cleanliness is part of conviction. Thank you very much once again!!!! I am very happy nnnnnnnnnnnnnnn!
Hi. A greeting to Moroccan people. We consider that the problem of wastes is a serious phenomenon for our Moroccan society. We must stop this problem of wastes. Thank you.
I like so much Tunisian and Moroccan films. But I hope that there will be other new films. May God assist you so much. May your Ramadan and breakfasting be accepted. Salam alikum.
Salam. I don't know why Rotana cinema is not functioning. I love the films of Rotana. Please brothers add my msn, I want to talk with you. Please present the film 'Ihna Btou El Autobus' by Adel Imam.
A nice site, but by adding pictures of carpets it would be even nicer.
Long live Husa, pride to them, for Jirarde.
Salam, how are you, I'm Redouane from Agadir, and this is a kiss to all Hasania of Agadir and long live Agadir and Hassania, but I have a comment about the future of the team, players and coach, because I noticed the deterioration of the team in recent years because they achieved no results and instability of the executive bureau of the team. Thanks.
I love Hassaniya club of Agadir and wish them prominence once again.
Salam. I am Amine. I play with Ittihad Taounate. I am 18. I play with amateurs. I ask for the assistance of some official. I want to play in a club.
Salam alaikoum, the new labour law is very important for all Moroccan people, but we are working without any official appointment and even without any paper. We're working in the company of Tissir Prima Gaz in Ouarzazate, God bless you, if there's any solution inform us as we're working without any timing and there are no annual leaves, thank you.
Jauoad Zairi is an excellent player and so is Hajji
You are all tyrants!
By God, I liked your words, I hope that it will find considering people.
May God guide everyone, God willing! Not every problem is the fault of Salafism! O destructors, people like you are the ones who have destroyed us not salafists. Do Tunisians not know what Salafism is??? The day will come when God will ask you what you did to this religion.
I die for you! Congratulations, may God grant you happiness! Sarah from Batna
On the occasion of the Maghreb Day for blood donation, I hope good health and happiness in life to all donors. On this occasion, everyone of us should become a regular benevolent donor. Thanks in advance.
I oppose such things. I haven't watched all the games for example. They are controlling us as they wish and this is dangerous.
I am crazy for you! If only I could reach you! I wish I could. I am crazy for you and just want to keep on watching you!
I love you all, namely Hajar, Farid and Soraya. Good luck on the tour.
I love you all and wish you success in star academy, Hamid and Hajar stars, we love you so much
"O Lord, forgive me and my parents and whoever enters my house as a believer and the believing men and believing women."
I want the email of the programme "Fatwa Ala Elhawa" ("Live Fatwa"). I want to ask them some questions.
To Moulay Abdellah Bouskraoui. May God reward you with good, please write in Arabic. You are damaging French. Write… like this, in Latin letters, in order to communicate your ideas well. (Chihab-25 this is my name and 25 is for you if you are a son of Ksar Es-Souk.)
This movie is very nice!
Hi Bassma. By God, God bless you and your voice. God willing you will be the star. We support you and will vote for you. Saadia.
Hi everyone. God willing, you will all get the baccalaureate, oh Lord.
Salam. I am your brother Chaouaib. I agree with you, but it is our mistake. Regardless of the causes, it is our mistake because the whole year long…you've known it. As for me, even if I haven't gotten through this year, I will try again. One must work hard. I don't think that those who work hard will fail. Some brothers say the questions were very complicated. Yes, I agree with you. But if you'd studied, you would have understood. Many friends relied on their efforts and God helped them. Some advice to you: Just forget these empty words, because they just increase the failure rate of pupils. I don't regret my failure, because I haven't worked hard. But this year, God willing, I will work hard. I hope to pass with honours. I wish success to all our young people. There is nothing better than education.
I want a definition of phosphate, may God reward you with good.
I want a slightly difficult exam.
I want forums for vocational training now.
I am a young man, 19. I have dropped out of school and want you to help me join vocational training. Thank you! Salam.
I am 19. I want to join vocational training team in order to learn a craft.
They call me Bojmaa. I study in Biougra in vocational training. I hope to get the degree. God is the assistant.
I want to join vocational training. How can I do that?
By God bring us some rock, that's all I ask for
Salam. I am 19. I dropped out of school from the first year of the lower secondary. I would like you to help me join vocational training. What are necessary conditions? Thank you!
Hi! I am Ahmed. I say to everyone who dropped out of school to go to vocational training. This will help them enhance their opportunities to work and stay away from illiteracy in general. I hope everyone will work more. Thank you!
Do these people want to drive us crazy or are we crazy? They have introduced the rapid train from Casa to Tangier while people live in slums. I wish from the depths of my heart an earthquake to this country.
By God Almighty, you have nothing more important to do just think of saving power? What about us, to hell with us? I think if there is some money it is ok. As to power, it is at our expense. There is nothing to do. You are very relaxed, you have nothing to do.
I want information about vocational training in the city of Fès.
Very good.
The Moroccan caftan is very distinct and has a special nature, particularly in Morocco. But I personally don't like the Moroccan caftan.
This is something clear and without exaggeration the Moroccan Kaftan is something incomparable meaning very chic. Long live Morocco and the beauty of Morocco. I love you, my country.
The authentic Moroccan caftan is very nice and excellent.
I love you, son of my country.
May God curse Al Qaeda and those who fight Muslims to the Day of Judgment!
My husband works in a restaurant in Italy. He wanted to do Omra. Some people told him it was not permissible because his money is not legitimate since he serves alcohol. But if he wants to change his job, we will need another source of living to avoid falling in Haram because we have four daughters, on rental and additional costs. Another job means will mean half the salary of my husband now. I hope you will offer me the adequate Fatwa. Thank you!
Every year we hear the same words.
Peace and mercy of God be upon you
I want information on the earthquake of Al Hoceima 2004. Thanks to everyone. ok excuse me, Bye, a good site.
My name is Sara. I like fashion so much!.
My comment is thank you. This is all I know. Thank you.
Hi, I'm Meryem. It's an excellent and nice site. We thank you, I found my research in this topic.
Thank you very much for what you did for us. Thank you very much. Bye.
I approve of wedding traditions in Morocco, as they haven't disappeared like other traditions. That's why we should stick to them.
To tell you the truth, I do not trust girls or boys- they're all opportunists. It has become very difficult to find a respectful woman or man, I am facing this dilemma myself, I want to marry but I am afraid to marry someone who will cause me problems.
The Moroccan wedding is nice in all its aspects, but the problem is with the brides of this era- they're thirsty for money.
salam alaikoum
Fatna Bent Lhosine is always in our hearts and we'll never forget her because she holds a large place in the hearts of Moroccans. May God have mercy on her.
I am one of the sons of Ouarzazate. I know its advantages and negative points. Ouarzazate has minerals, tourism and cinema industry. This means that Ouarzazate is one of the biggest cities in terms of producing work, but the problem is that there are no work opportunities. Imagine - I am a son of Ouarzazate and go to work in Nador, which is about 820 km away from Ouarzazate. Isn't this an injustice?
Why this discrimination? You organize festivals only in cities you choose. Do some in the east, some in the South, some in the North and some in West. I hope you will appreciate my opinion.
I want to draw the attention to organizers of festivals to include all regions of Morocco and not be limited to some cities. Thank you.
The city of Ouarzazate is very nice. I live in Ouarzazate exactly in Skoura, centre. However, there is a close town to Ouarzazate at about 50 km. It is Kalaa Megouna where there are prostitution houses. By God this is a real catastrophe. Where are officials? There are about 800 houses. They are all for prostitution. This is a shame. Morocco is an Islamic country. Where is Islam? From God we are and to God we shall return. Oh people, carry out jihad by cleaning the town. May God reward you with good.
Hi! I am one of the fans of Moroccan Kaftan. I am crazy for the Kaftan because it is the symbol of Morocco. I wish a successful career to everyone who designs Kaftan a successful career.
I like Fnair and like all their songs, I love Fnair.
The best coach is Zaki. The day on which Zaki left and the team is dropping. They must advance to the world cup. This is a shame because it is the third time we don't advance to it. We long to see our team playing in the world cup God willing.
This is not pleasant.
By God, this is not normal!
Ok, I don't accept the idea of colonization because acording to the saying 'Love for your brother what you love for yourself, thank you'.
Salam alaikoum. Morocco forever, inchallah Moroccans should make us happy, so make us happy players.
Salam, is it possible?
Salam my sister. God bless you. I ask God to grant you success in your professional life and family life in general. I also hope from God that you will be an example for all students to work together and rehabilitate education in Morocco as we all know its situation. I am Abdelkader, 21, third year law. I wish success to everyone. May God protect you.
God bless you my sister. Say God bless her so that you won't affect her with the bad eye. The bad eye is very serious, ask the expert. May God compensate me with something better.
I am Souad. I am 9. I am happy for your achievement my sister. Many congratulations, I wish success to all Muslims.
Hajar I love you so much and Hamid, my greetings to Majda Alghami my friend. Bye, congratulations.
This site is very nice I thank its administrators. I'm Sahrawi from the occupied territory in the Western Sahara.
Long live Jihad for freedom.
You will regret Kadhafi, may God rest his soul in peace!
This is not a good topic, it is annoying.
There is no other God but Allah, Mohamed is the prophet of God! O Libyan people, we know that you were oppressed in the past by Kadhafi, yes but don't forget that Kadhafi died as well as martyr. Our religion orders us to treat prisoners in a good way. However, what you did isn't a feature of Muslims. A dead is honoured by being buried. But you left Kadhafi and his son in this way. We ask God to forgive us, you and all Muslims. May God rest the souls of all our dead Muslims in peace, o Lord, thank you!
Long live Algeria, Tunisia and Morocco. Thanks to the Tunisians and Moroccan brothers. God willing Algeria and Tunisia will go to the world cup in spite of the Egyptians, they won't advance any more. Long live the Maghreb united.
There is no trust anymore.
I agree with you.
In my opinion, marriage of very young people is madness. It's not right. I am against marriage of very young people. There are young people who don't even have a room and are unemployed. They only eat and sleep, still they marry!
Nice and great.
conserved
A big joy!
Hiba loves the wellness and solidarity with people with disabilities I love peace, humanity includes all the people of the world.
I am looking for a job.
Not bad comment. However, is there something to do or it is again favoritism? Nearly more than half the people in Morocco are jobless. You can consider that 5% are working. As for the rest, they are almost jobless as you know how salaries are.
I wish you a successful career. I love you, Rashir.
O Lord!
I am Yassin from Khmisset. I am looking for a job as a small truck driver, 3,500 tonnes, a car or any job. Thank you!
I love you so much Hajar and wish you success over all, my greetings to Abdelhamid and I encourage him as well, with success, Hanane from Casablanca
I agree with all your requests.
This is not true.
Salam. I want addresses of human rights associations in Berkane please. Thank you.
Hi, I need help.
Salam. My sister is beaten by her husband. He also attacks us in our house. What can we do?
I thank you for your efforts.
Is it not a shame on you that you challenged the best creatures of God? There is no power and no will but from God. O Lord establish our footing and support us against the wrongdoers!
No matter how infidels try hard, they won't defeat Islam and Muslims because the power of Islam is strong and the power of our Muslim belief is greater than the light of the skies and earth.
May God tarnish the faces of the infidels! How can they draw the great messenger of God, who was sent as mercy to the worlds? May God tarnish the faces of those who disbelieved in God and the messenger! I call upon Muslims to rise up for the support of Islam and Muslims!
Jews live with us, viva Tunisia!
My son is mad about the hip hop, rac, or what they call it. He spends all day long singing with them. Whenever I watch something or what they call it, I ask him who he is, he says Bigg. May God protect young people today. Music is obsessing them.
I want to learn more about Morocco in the educational field.
Mami is my favourite and all his songs
Exalted be God!
Victory will come from God the Almighty. So all Muslims must therefore put hand in hand to defeat the disbelievers.
God will hold them accountable for what they did. Allah will take revenge on them!
God forbids! The prophet is not like other humans. He is a human but not like humans, He is a ruby in the middle of stones.
In the name of God the most gracious the most merciful. "Allah has set a seal upon their hearts and upon their hearing, and over their vision is a veil. And for them is a great punishment." God speaks the truth. God is sufficient for us and He is the best disposer of affairs. O Lord confer your peace and blessings upon our prophet, the last messenger! O Lord don't deprive us from seeing his noble face, O Lord amen!
God is sufficient for me and He is the best disposer of affairs forever.
God is the greatest! God is the greatest! I witness there is no other God but Allah, I witness Mohamed is the messenger of God. I believe in God.
God bless you!
Congratulations!
Salam, I'm Khawla I live in Morocco in star academy I don't like Ahmed, sorry that's the truth.
Salam I'm Soukaina from Morocco we're glad to see star academy
Shame on them, really! The day will come when Libyans regret him. Why? Will someone better than him replace him? I don't think so. Those who killed him can't be Muslims.
Salam alikum people of Sidi Lakhdar.
May God rest his soul! I liked Rami so much. I am the cousin of Tahra. Greetings to you! Thank you! Manal from Morocco!
Salam. I thank you for this help and ask God to grant success.
Salam. This film denigrating our dear prophet Mohamed is like strife for Islam and offence to it. We hope from all our hearts that investigations will be conducted with everyone who has a hand in this hideous act. Thank you!
Salam alikum. I thank Wydad for the title of 2010! Thank you!
Hi, how are you? I thank you for what you did so that we may learn from it. Thank you.
He is a crown over all of our heads, peace and blessings of God be upon our master Mohamed and all his companions.
O Lord confer your blessings on our master Mohamed! Woe to anyone who denigrates our dear Mohamed who guided us out from darkness to light. So don't keep quiet o Muslims and sacrifice your souls for him as he did for us.
In the name of God the most gracious the most merciful. This is enormous. If you see a vice, change it with your hand; if you can't, change it with your mouth; if you can't, change it with your heart and this is the lowest level of belief.
I am a Moroccan citizen. I am against what happened in this era. I protest against what the Americans did. There is a shot in the film quoted from Holy Qur'an which says that Islam will defeat disbelievers in the end.
I will sacrifice everything I have for the messenger. This belief is thanks to you.
A high militant greeting! I address it to every Amazigh who tries hard for his Amazigh identity. A militant greeting to all people who aspire to liberation on top of them the Amazigh people. A militant greeting to opinion detainees of the Amazigh cultural movement including the golden stars Mustapha Ousaya and Hamid Ouadouch. A militant greeting to everyone who sacrifices his blood for his just and legitimate cause. I wish Amazigh people in general to reach its destination soon through union of all Amazigh on Tamzgha land. We hope to see it in our lifetime. If we die we ask God to have mercy on us!
For how long will the situation remain like this?
Passing.
LAPDE? There is no difference between them and ALPDE.
Even if they bring Zidane to play with them, they won't do anything.
You kill women and children and you say that you're carrying out holy war. Shame on you! No to terrorism and killing women. Just think if it were your daughter who was killed in the explosion and you hold it in pieces. Think, Ben Laden- you're an oppressor. Nador.
I haven't understood anything.
Salam I'm Mohamed from Morocco. I'm not with Ben Laden or USA or FRA I'm with serious work, I'm with the welfare, prosperity and knowledge to all Muslims. Long live the Arab Maghreb. Happy Eid.
Enough
Salam. How are you? I am Hicham from Jijel. I am 23. I tell these terrorists, may God guide them, to tell the truth, they are the ones who have corrupted the country and have ruined my life and the life of all young people. Moreover, they have brought Bouteflika who has allegedly reformed the country but in reality he increased our oppression and made the living costs higher. However, there is God. There is God. So there is victory or martyrdom.
Salam.
Go ahead Ziani.
I die for Hip Hop style and American singers like Eminem.
Hip hop forever. Fnaire are the best rap music in Morocco. Thank you. Moroccan hip hop forever.
I want Lmoutcho and the film you're showing now because this channel is very, very nice, this the only channel I watch from Italy and I ask God to assist you and grant you success inchallah, happy new year.
Our great singer Bigg, I want to say you have great songs. For me you're the best rap singer (bigg casa crew h-kayne+casa system). I also sing rap and hip hop. But I've found no one to help me. With your songs, help us, Bigg. I want to form a group of four. OK, take care.
Sahara my country.
Salam. By God, today I am optimistic will win this team. But they haven't called Zemama. He is the key of our national team, ok, because we have no one who is as daring as Zemama and Taarabte. They can vie for the ball with anyone who comes on their way. The presence of Hamdaoui is important, he can do something.
Dancers of Atlas not Atlas Lions! National team is always 0000! Players are (expletive). Viva Soufiane El Oujdi El Alloudi!
I would like to tell Moroccans that king Mohamed VI is the king of Morocco and Moroccans love their king. Salam alikum.
The federation is teasing us. They hired a coach with 150 millions while people are starving. We have dropped Zaki who took us to the finals because the federation has no patriotism. There are just void protocols.
Salam. I am Samir from Azilal. I love national team. I hope they will win in coming games.
Thank you for this advice.
Salam alikum. Badou Zaki is the best coach in Africa. We support you Morocco but only if the champion of Africa Badou Zaki returns.
Salam alikum Maghreb people. We are Moroccans and love our country. Therefore, we have to choose a national coach such as Mostafa Madih or the respectable man Bado Zaki.
I am so sorry for the Umma of Islam and Muslims! This has become your sole concern! From when were borders between us? These borders were made by the west in order to separate Muslims.
I witness there is no other God but Allah and I witness that Mohamed is the messenger of God.
Sahara is Moroccan and will remain Moroccan. If you're not happy with this drink the sea!
This death penalty is shameful. By God death penalty is shameful. Please abolish it.
Go and open a site for the recruitment of unemployed young people. Stop this extravagance and be men.
nothing to say, there's no will and no power but from God.
May God protect you, make the exam a bit easier as we've only one hope, it's not easy to lose one year of your life, and thanks.
This is very nice!
Please, don't use the expression Arab Maghreb. We aren't Arabs. Sorry, thank you!
Please make the second session easy
Really this article is excellent and great
Miam, its taste is good. I liked Couscous a lot, I liked it from the very start.
Let them say whatever they want. There is God. He is the One, he is the revenger and you will see what will happen to them. It has already begun with Sandy, and there is more to come. So wait for a war by God. You shouldn't feel secure from the plan of God.
Like USMA like MCA, none is stronger than JSK.
Thank you so much.
I wish success to Muslims.
I hate Salafists a lot.
Ezzahi...ehhh I swear that you're in my heart and will stay there until the end of the world. May God protect you from the eye Ammar Ezzahi I listen to your songs 'Ida Nmout biya fatouma', 'Lebla fel Kholta', 'Rbeh Mel Iitizal' and 'Ghadar Kassek ya ndim'... May God grant you long life our cheikh to serve the era inchallah...Smail Kouba.
Who makes the gatherings nice but our brother Amar the lively. But the problem is that Ezzahi doesn't want to be publicised- why??? We wished to see him one day in a recital, otherwise, where are his fans working in the artistic field at least an homage even if he's absent, a fan.
Hello, I wish success to all Muslim and myself so that we succeed. This is my goal.
I passed the baccalaureate and would like to study at university in the subject of physics. I need information about how to register. Finally, thank you for this site!
I passed the baccalaureate without honours. However, I made big efforts. I thought I would get a high score. But all my dreams were scattered. Everything is lost for me. The biggest problem is that I have a good score in class exams. What can I do? All my dreams were crushed. Some students with me don't work hard but they had good scores.
I passed the baccalaureate without honours. However, I don't know what to do yet. I need your help and right orientation. Thank you!
I am not sure what to do after the baccalaureate. I study human sciences.
Salam alikum. My name is Zaynab. I am still waiting for the results of the baccalaureate. I would like to know the names of good private schools which have good prospects. I study the subject of human sciences. I hope you will advise me in this field. I don't want to be lost and waste years.
But those who lived in Europe have many friends. If he wants to talk, what should he do?
What I learnt about the Moudawana to this day is good. I thank you for this site. Thank you!
Why was the family law been adopted? What has it granted for women, especially in matters related to divorce? What has it achieved for women?
Salam alikum. I would like to know if it is really true that if a woman remarries, law deprives her of her children even if the father doesn't ask for it. If she has an opportunity to go to Europe, can she take her child with her even if he is only 2? Please reply to my msn!
Salam. I am married but I discovered that my husband has been previously married. What does law say about this? By the way he produced a document stating that he was single. Now he says that he married her before consuming marriage. Is this considered fraud? What does law say about this?
I am against some conditions which stipulate preventing polygamy or restricting polygamy with conditions. It is said in a hadith of the prophet that a Companion wanted to have children so the prophet ordered him to marry until he married the fourth wife. There is comfort and prosperity in it within the framework of justness.
I married in the 7th month of the year and my daughter was born in the 10th month. What should I do to formalize her documents? They refused to add her to the civil status records.
Honestly, God bless you. A great artist. May God protect your wife and children. Keep up your work. You are the Charokhan of Morocco.
You know, everyone has his freedom. However, he must respect the freedom of others. In addition, those who encourage this phenomenon will be held accountable by God.
If the girl is not Muslim, she should respect the morals of Islam because she is in a Muslim country. But if she is Muslim, she is the one who didn't respect the feelings of these people. She is the one who has harassed them because she didn't wear decent clothes first of all.
Pride to the sons of the country.
I thank athletes especially Hicham El Guerrouj.
I think that Moroccans have a lot to write about their country. However, I don't know why they go to other countries. Anyway, their articles are good. However, I wish they would progress more than this.
As Moroccans say, if you commit a sin, you deserve punishment. If you kill, you should be killed as well.
By God, I liked to the topic so much. I say Azul to you Muslims. Everyone will die. There is no other God but Allah, Mohamed is the messenger of God. Nice warm greetings to you. I want you to help me with the alphabet, I want to learn them. Bye.
Azul. I tell you greetings. I invite you to visit my hometown, Lakhssas, Tiznit, Morocco. I speak Tachlhit. There are many dialects in Morocco including Tarifit and Tamazighit. I want Amazigh people to be united so that we will understand what they say. I am an artist painter. I have many paintings about the writings of Tamazight, Tifinagh. I hope there will be an exposition of Amzigh painters in which we will show paintings of Amazigh artist painters.
Salam alikum. My name is Tarek. I live in Mohammedia. I am gifted in music. I sing oriental songs. I haven't found any help because there are no music institutions in Mohammedia. I would like to join a music institution. Thank you!
Amazigh to blood. Amazigh forever.
My sister has breast cancer. She has been undergoing chemotherapy for ten months. She had a surgery but it wasn't successful. So the disease moved to the head. The cost of a surgery for the head might reach 70,000 dirhams. So what is the solution for a poor person?
To my Amazigh brothers and to everyone who witnesses there is no other God but Allah, Mohamed is the messenger of God, nice greetings. Wish you all the good for what you did for Tamazight to be widespread in the country, to be spoken by everyone, young and old, Arabs and foreigners. Bye.
Salam alikum. I am 26. My mother died of breast cancer. Now I am suffering from the same symptoms. I feel a severe pain in my left hand and my left breast. I have a slightly big lump close to my left breast. I have doubts that it is cancer just like my mother. I don't know what do or where to go. Please, if possible advise me what to do. My family is poor. Please don't spare me your advice!
Salam alikum. I wish recovery to everyone. May God make things easy for everyone! Please, I would like to know symptoms of breast cancer.
Salam. I hope there will be some consideration. I am 22. Four years ago, I found a cyst in my breast. I suffer a lot especially in my stomach. My intestines are burning. I had a surgery. I removed the cyst. But it has reappeared again. Pain is now more severe than before. I had a second surgery and was followed up by a physician who said that my disease wasn't malign. However, I doubt it is a form of cancer. The pain is still there and it is like a short circuit in the heart and the stomach to the point that I jump. I am easily tired and irritated. Now, from time to time, my hands are heavy and can't move them a lot. They are like paralysed when I work or carry something heavy. I lost the appetite. I am losing weight. I don't know what to do. I am tired of medicines and its unnecessary costs. Please advise me, may God reward you with all the good. Will this pain accompany me all my life or will this disease kill me?
I hope that our language will be unified and show the history to all the people of Tamazgha and victims of arabisation. Greetings to you. I am an Amazigh from the Rif.
May God heal all Muslims!
May God heal everyone, amen!
May God heal all cancer patients including my mother and all the Umma of our master Mohamed.
Tell me if there is a job or are these just words?
I greet every participant in this site especially baccalaureate students. I wish everyone of them success. By God, I want to know if the passing rate this year will be low or high. Thank you with my wishes of success.
There is nothing. I wrote them many times in order to help me set up a business but in vain.
ANAPEC Morocco is very weak. It doesn't have the power to help young people. Workers are just sitting there, they don't know what to do.
I am looking for a job.
Welcome. I would like to ask if they take a specific rate in the second session. Thank you.
Hello. This is Sana 2009. Pupils who had a 0 in the regional exam risk failure in the exam. I want a reply as soon as possible because I am confused.
Congratulations to all of you, very good!
The Mouloudia of Algiers is my heart. Really, it's a very good match. I adore Mouloudia, always nice with MCA long live MCA inchallah. May God grant them success, good luck.
It is better to implement this measure for those who are condemned to suspended prison sentences. As for others, they should go to prison.
A dead is honoured by his burial. Who are you? Who are you? You will see your future. It will be worse than that of Iraqis. It is a shame, he said it to presidents and princes. It will be your turn and you will see this.
Poor Moroccans, may God grant them patience. We haven't gone to the world cup for years now. It is possible we will never go there, hahahaha.
It is more than great, God bless you.
Is it not possible to silence Kadhafi?
Moamer Kadhafi is the king of Libya. He is the king of kings not ousted, he is Mujahid in his country. He is Mujahid in the country. Others are robbers, those who support Jews, Christians and filthy NATO, o filthy! Dr Aicha spoke the truth. She is in the property of God, not in the property of anyone. God supports her. She is in Algeria which is the property of God not the property of anyone. Now, I will conclude and say everyone on earth will die. One day for us and one day against us. Pride is for us and there is no pride for you, agents of NATO, monkeys and pigs! God suffices us and He is the best mandate!
This is not reasonable, they have exaggerated too much.
Salam alikum. Thank you for this site as you present suggestions. Thank you very much.
Bravo.
O Allal, if Kadhafi is a skilled man, we wish him victory against the enemies of Islam, we support him to the last drop.
They have exaggerated too much, may God guide them for us.
I want to get a license
I am happy and I would like to participate with you.
I will say substantively that Arabs agreed to disagree.
Salam alikum Fatin and Kawtar. I thank you all, and especially you.
This is not true.
I don't agree with these elections because they are all fraud and lies to the citizen. My name is Lamiaa. I live in Darb Ghalaf.
Honestly, we don't trust anyone anymore. This is why I won't vote for anyone. They promise but they don't keep their promises.
This is a very nice program
I want to participate.
I want to watch the movie "Keda Red", please!
The family code is very important namely for us women.
Salam I'm Zineb from Morocco I want to say that Hajar is the star and she's the nicest girl, Hamid, Farah, and Kawtar I wish you success and Morocco forever, I love you so much, good luck
I'm Moroccan, I want to say that Faten is the sweetest in the Dar. Please support her because she deserves to continue in the competition and I like Hajar
We are Muslims. We implement this Islam. Islam is a bounty sent from God so that we live in harmony because Islam is the Sunna of the messenger, peace and blessings of God be upon him. As for those who smuggle goods and oil of Algeria, this is not our business. It is the business of the government. The government fights all forms of smuggling including traffic of humans and traffic of arms. We are ruined by bribery. One should be real Muslim who loves the truth he should wish the same for people so that we can moved ahead. Thank you!
Badou Zaki is the best Moroccan coach recently. Bravo Zaki.
Go to do things which will be beneficial to you. The Day of Judgment is close by, the Jews are invading Muslims and you are following football. May God guide us all.
I love Hajar in the star academy so much.
You are my favourite team!
Kadhafi lived as a leader and was killed as a martyr. O Libya, you won't live the day of victory! O traitors, a dead person is honoured by burying him! He is living by his Lord. May God rest your soul in peace leader!
Any individual who kills innocents deserves an end like the end of Kadhafi.
By God my friend you're always dear to me.
My comment is that this is the best line-up. Well done, Saadane, for these players you choose 4-4-2. I I address my greetings to Ziani, Antar, Yahya and all players of Algeria. 1, 2, 3 long live Algeria. It is my love, sleep, sleep and the ball sleeps. Algeria is my love, football, football, we are good. Bring us Egypt and we will teach it. Algeria will win, God willing.
Long live Algeria. God willing we will win 4-0, yeah.
I love Nass El Ghiwane, especially their song "Allah Ya Moulana" (God our Lord).
I love Nass El Ghiwane so much, I will never forget them.
I love Nass El Ghiwane so much, Omar from Casablanca.
I have a lot of information about this tree. I hail from the region of Agadir in the south of Morocco where Argan trees grow. **Phone number removed by editor**. Thank you!
Salam. I want to take the exam.
This is a real problem. I am coming next week. This means I am stalled.
Okkk
I want to watch a show on Moroccan Kaftan. Thanks
Magharebia by God, I love you Asala Nasri so much
My dream is to play in Barcelona. However, I am 17. Is it my age which will prevent me from joining Barcelona team? I play well with the left leg.
Bassma is a star. Vote for her please. She needs your votes. Bassma a star! Please vote for Morocco...
Bassma is the star against their will.
Peace, mercy and blessings of God be upon you. Bassma deserves the title of star academy 6 God willing. She is a star. Peace, mercy and blessings of God be upon you.
I will sacrifice my father and mother for you, o messenger of God!
I love so much Bassma. May God protect her for her mother. I hope she will be the first Moroccan girl to win the star. She deserves it. Her voice is nice, God bless her. As to her values, she is respectable. Those who see her otherwise are just jealous of her. We hope that we will put hand in hand and vote for her all so that she will take the title and show to all the world that Morocco is not easy. We will also lift the flag of Morocco high. Please vote for her not just to take the title but to take the highest number with a good rate. Bassma, even if I have much to say, I will not go on. I will just say Bassma is the star no matter what happens. I hope you will support her.
Bassma, I die for you my darling. Good luck with Brahim. Why aren't you on good terms with Micho? Michi please go to Bassma and kiss her, please. Soukayna, Morocco.
I love Bassma so much. She is a star by God and we are all with her with our votes.
Useless statements, meaningless rumours, people without reason and without mentality. We hope that people will restore their senses.
God's curse on them! May He disperse the enemies of Islam!
I am a young girl, 19. I failed in the baccalaureate exam. I would like to enrol in vocational training. However, I don't know if it is still possible for me to register or not.
I am a student from Tamri. I am 21. I study in the second year of the baccalaureate. I want a modern training.
I am Marhib. I was studying in the lower secondary but I dropped out of school. Now I don't know what to do. I hope you will help me study at a center for vocational training and promotion of labour. I want a reply please!
I am Abdo from Beni Mellal. I failed the baccalaureate. I decided to study building in vocational training. What is your advice? Thank you!
I would like to ask you if possible, may God protect you, what to do if you want to enroll in vocational training in mechanics?
O men, Algerians are starving and they still say Sahara is ours!
We have no channels or films. The actors and TV hosts are boring. Their films and programmes are boring. Morocco is not good at making anything except empty words and gossip. I personally have deleted Moroccan channels from the digital receiver.
I love the Moroccan Kaftan so much. I hope that you send me pictures of a group or set of kaftans. Thank you.
Salam alikum. Khadija from Morocco. I like Abdlhamid, Ahmad and Farah. I wish them success.
I like the Moroccan caftan, kisses to it.
I am Sofia from Rabat. I love so much Cheb Bilal. Long live Bilal. By God, it is only Bilal who is there.
Yes, Bilal has realistic songs. I have attended Mawazine festival and saw the audience in attendance to see Bilal. It was far more than the audience of Asala, Nancy, Diana and David Vendita.
Hi Farid, I love you so so much and like you so so much my love, and good luck in your life and music, bye bye
Hi Rabie. I am very proud of you because firstly you're an actor and handsome. You're also smart. This is what made me become interested in you although honestly I am not attracted by Moroccan artists. But you seem different. So now I want your phone number to know you more. Ok this is my phone number. I hope you like my letter and didn't take much of your time. Ok good luck.
I like athletics and I am disabled. I would like to join the team of players with special needs. I hope you will give me an opportunity to play this good sport. Thank you!
Hi by God I love you so much and you're very dear you're a star
I am serious, you're very beautiful and I am very happy to see you in Tunisia!
I love Libya so much and don't accept what happens today. By God, this is inacceptable! It is a very nice country! By God, it is inacceptable!
Hi Nancy Ajram. You are very beautiful and we are happy with you. Thank you very much.
We are against any rapprochement with Algeria as long as its generals target us (events of Marrakech).
Agriculture is the most important thing in life.
ok
My name is Saida. I hail from Ouarzazate. I like it so much although I live far away. I live in Casablanca. I really like my country which has a rich heritage. There are many cultural, economic and social activities, traditions, customs and special celebrations in the city of Ouarzazate.
The city of Ouarzazate is a very nice city. I hope to visit it because it is a Moroccan city.
No words about what I say about Ouarzazate.
I thank so much everyone who contributed to this destruction and explosion.
Oh, this is very nice, by God! This is the nicest thing in Maghreb. Personally, I like star. Those who don't like it should strike their heads to the wall haha.
This is great. May God bless you! This is an excellent topic.
I would like to tell you thank you very much!

My brother Rabie El Kati, I call you my brother because you really look like my brother. My brother is in prison, I love him so much but I didn't have the opportunity to see him. But when I see you it is as if I saw him. As it is said there are 40 copies of every person. You are really identical to the picture of my brother Hamid. However, when my mother sees you, she cries as if she has seen her son Hamid even in his voice especially when you act the role of a prisoner. I also think that you are like him in everything. This is his sister Zhour, 16. I wish you success my brother Rabie. I apologise if I have bothered you with my case. There is more really this is because I missed my brother. I am sorry for disturbing you. I hope that you accept, this is my msn to tell you more. I wish you success and great fame. Thank you.
Salam. Honestly Rabie you are a good artist, great in your roles, performance and all your works are very great. I wish you success and continuity in new works. Thank you.
Hi Mr Rabie, how are you? By the way Rabie, I will not deny this, many people liked you so much the first time they saw you because it is clear from your roles that your personality is strong. Therefore, you always have good roles. We wish you success, God willing, your dreams will be realised. Amen.
I am a Moroccan woman. But I say, honestly, we need experience in acting. I prefer that this Moroccan actor Rabie would show his skills in foreign films. He would have been the best actor. Sorry for this honesty. Thank you.
Is it possible to make a simple research on this topic
I am a Moroccan young man. I like Rabie El Kati so much . My wish is to see him in person. I like "El Farah Saghir" and all his films so much. I wish him success from all my heart. I love you Rabie.
Nothing interesting in this piece!!
No to terrorism!
There is no one who watched you and didn't go mad!
I am a student who has the baccalaureate. I hope you will help me choose the most suitable path for me.
I am Fatima Zohra from El Jadida. I study in the second year of the baccalaureate, humanities. I would like to know my future in this branch after passing the baccalaureate exam. I mean if there are any prospects at university or private schools.
Hi. If I tell you I love you, it is too little for you. You are always in our hearts. You are the best singer in the world. I love you. Since I was young, my mother played your tapes. I learnt them all by heart. I buy all your new albums. Yes, I love you to death. My only wish is to see you. I always ask God to grant me my wish of seeing you. I can't tell you what do you represent for me. Oh Lord don't deprive me of seeing you. I wish you more success and prominence. You are always with us in our hearts.
I love you! Long live Saida Fekri and the Riff mountains.
Why does repression still persist? Why are we sons of the people always repressed?
My name is Ali. I want better orientation about private schools.
I am a student. I will sit for the baccalaureate exam this year. My problem is that I am scared about the bac because I didn't get a good mark in the regional exam. I am scared to fail in the bac. I ask God the Almighty to achieve my dream even if I don't get good scores; Oh Lord help me!
Salam. I would like to know if it is possible to know prospects of art students after the baccalaureate and what are conditions for every speciality.
We love you and want you with us in Morocco. You are the best Arab singer who has supported the Palestinian and Arab cause in general. I love you forever and welcome in Morocco.
Good good a nice site
I want a research about long jump.
Long live our country and Arab football.
I like this site and encourage the owner of this site
Are you still quarreling Libyans? What have you done to Moamer?
Are you well Maghreb academy Abdelhamid you have to work hard and good luck
Salam alikoum. Honestly, I have read all these comments and honestly all of them flow in the same course, the educational system in Morocco is severely deteriorating. I also noticed that there are many questions but I haven't read any reply to any of them. I am also a student in the baccalaureate this year and I will also add a question and hope to find an answer. How are the papers of the exam corrected and what is the rate of success this year? Thank you, may God rest the souls of your parents.
...Ah yes thank god
Shame on you! Is this your gratitude?
I have a talent. I live in Tangier. Once I finish my studies, I will play. The most important thing is that we ask his majesty to open some academy in the north so that it will be close to us since in the north and in Tangier in particular, there are many talents!!!
Hi! If these people who assaulted her are really Muslim, they wouldn't have even looked at her thoroughly. Everyone is free in their choices. Of course no one has the right if he doesn't like something about me to come and beat me or raise his voice at me!
Happy Eid!
Why don't you play well?
How are you? I am very impressed by this site. It is extraordinary. Thank you and good luck.
I have a brother who is disabled. I ask you to guide me to an association please. My father is jobless. It is just my mother who struggles for a living. If there is any benefactor to sympathize with us for the sake of God. Salam.
Salam. I have a complaint. It is about the Caid and Cheikh in Tangier. They distribute aid by reducing flour, tea and sugar. This is a shame. You want people to hate the king?
Hi! How are you? I am Fatima. Thank you very much for this great site. It is very nice!
A shame a shame a shame, shame on you
I love you Hajar so much and you're the best one there and and I want to ask Hamid whether he loves you
The support of the messenger of God shouldn't be through protests, burning flags and breaking shops. The support should be with mouths and good manners, "And indeed, you are of a great moral character," follow the way he dressed and all the acts of the messenger, peace and blessings of God be upon him. In this way, the Muslim would have supported the messenger of God, peace and blessings of God be upon him.
God is the greatest! This alone is enough. God is the greatest! God is the greatest!
By God, this is unacceptable!
I am a Moroccan young woman. I liked this idea of Maghreb participation which we have been aspiring to for long. Anyway, I like my country so much. I like everything sacred including the king who is dear to our hearts. I see that he is always thinking about the people. We in turn want to serve our king by contributing to development especially in the social field. I have efficient ideas I learnt from civil society action and work with young people in my country. I hope to meet an official in the education system. My greetings to Moroccan government!
Salam. My name is Zair Allali. I am looking for a job. I have no diploma. I am a driver. I have driving licenses in these categories B, C, D, EC. I have worked in a business but it didn't record me.
Mr F, it seems you are an intellectual. I like so much your articles you and Mr Rouani, but honestly this is the proper reply. There is no more I can say.
I thank Morocco because it is the best country in the world.
I am a young man, 29. I study in the baccalaureate level. I have a diploma of technician in production and quality of confection and cost technician. Thank you very much!
I am a Moroccan young man. I have applied to this programme of Moukawalati but there were no results. When we submitted our files, they were filed like first applications. Are the ideas and dreams of young people dealt with in this way by officials? Or is it because they are already working and securing a salary in their pockets? I don't care about others. But where are the doors you're talking about? Where? The question remains without reply for some moment. Waiting for that moment, although I know no one will read this comment and that no official will reply to me.
I would like to go to Morocco to have a good life. There are many Harragas in Italy. Our Moroccan brothers, freedom forever!
Peace of God be upon you. I am looking for a job. I have a diploma in hair-dressing. I live in Spain. I would like to work in my country Morocco. Thank you!
Long live the king, but you are just liars!
Which business and which jobs are you talking about? Do you really know rights of workers or you just pretend to? You big businesses deprived workers of their rights. You make promises but you don't keep them. This is the problem of all Arabs. You are pretty aware of this. So there is no need to lie to each other. On top of all this, I think this business which spreads information of its countries. However, this time if you want to publish a topic, you have to keep your promises! My greetings to all liars!
By God, I really cried at this action. Shame on him! This is the situation of our people. May God help them! In reality, the people of Algeria are good. May God reward them with all the good!
Jihad has become terrorism for you. There is no power and no will but from God.
I think these are lies about the man.
Salam alaikoum. I would like to join the vocational training centre after I got negative results at school and I'm asking whether it's good or not.
I want from you information about vocational training, thank you.
Raja fans to death, Raja forever.
Hi, God bless RAJA.
Hello Raja fans!
Long live Cheb Bilal alone because he talks so much about reality and many things are said by Bilal happened really to people. Bilal is respectable not as you said that he is wasting away the reputation of the rai. Bilal started and he has nothing not like those who borrowed and appointed other people to help them so that they achieve fame. The king of rai is cheb Bilal, by God, because his words are indecent (hka hna kima hak li brana nbroh wli ykrahn…) (we are like this, if you like us,we're faithful to you and if you hate us…)
I am the son of Sidi Lakhdar. Long live Sidi Lakhdar a billion times. Long live Haj Wajad. I have seen everything. Long live Ibrahim Ganet who illegally immigrated to Malaga, Toulouse. My brother from Toulouse, Nounou. Long live Hamou Batbat, Hadou, Ahmed Hiwar my partner.
Good!
I support everyone who defends Tamazight. I support everyone who loves his origins.
Well done!
I am 13. I listen a lot to Fnaire group. I love you so much and hope that you come to the town of Ahfir, Aghbal, ok.
How great you are Maryam! Your voice is angelic especially when you sang "Benak Ben Allah". Honestly, you sang well the Libyan songs. May God protect you, oh Lord, and you always sing Libyan songs. It is a pity that we don't hear your voice again.
I am from Morocco. I want to know whether you have some news about Abdelhamid.
Hi. I am Moustapha from Tetouan. Long live Barcelona
I like the song Manana. I am Salma from Casa. I also like those who sing this nice song. I thank these guys who made these songs. Thank you.
Hi Fnaire. Honestly, you are a great band. I wish you a successful career God willing.
I am getting attached to you.
I really love Fnaire because they are optimistic about the future of our Morocco. this is how we should be, we the Moroccans about the future of our country.
I am from Tiznit. I love Fnaire so much and in all my time I sing their songs.
I like your program. I want to participate with you. Thanks
Where are the stars of Maghreb Star Ac? What is their news and recent accomplishments?
My love is asooooooomaaaaa
O people of wind and air, I defy anyone to talk about Algeria. There is no single country in the Maghreb or even in the world which made sacrifices like Algeria. Who has led ten years of war against terrorism except us? We are still standing steadily. We can even resist another ten years because we are men and no one can do what Algerians did. This is because we are real men in action not just words, o people of wind and air!
Hi everyone. I am Simo from Saudi Arabia. But my native country is Morocco. As usual, pride to Morocco. I love Bigg to death. He is the best singer who gained fame in rap in a direct way. My advice, Bigg it is not just talking. I tell you my Moroccan brother, if you want to know you can listen to Bigg, the way they play is shameful, some kids as Bigg called, are meaningless, because the strong are always strong. We must avoid the problem of one not the son of the country, he won't understand us. "Bilal" the mind of Moroccan young people. As you know everything. Thank you.
Hi everyone. I encourage Diae Ataibi and wish from my heart to all the Moroccans to support her because she deserves to remain in the final. Kenza from Zaio, Morocco.
Thieves.
By God the Almighty. You are great. I am crazy for you. I always cry with you. May God protect you my beauty. Always on the top, top. I love you.
Which Darija are we talking about? They are dubbing in slang. Now we listen to indecent words, don't we Mr Hicham Mouajjah?
I would like to have the address or phone number of the biggest clinics in Morocco for plastic surgery in burnings. I had burns of the third degree in my belly and thighs.
May God grant you success.
I have big ambitions in football to play with the Moroccan national team. My love for football is more than anything. I love football, viva!
In reality, your songs are nice but not great.
I don't like him.
I love you Nasro.
Is it possible to get a loan from Islamic banks in order to work abroad? Thank you very much! If possible, please give me necessary information.
I love this singer very much and always listen to his music. I wish to get his msn address. I am a big fan. If you want my address here it is. Nasro Always.
I hail from Morocco. I live in the city of Erfoud close to Errachidia. I love football. I always train in the stadium. I wish to have an opportunity to play in the academy.
I am a student in the third year of the lower secondary. I don't know whether to choose science or arts. My question is which is the best subject?
God willing they will win tomorrow.
I congratulate everyone who works in the hip.
Morocco should begin research in the arms industry to protect territorial integrity.
I like the artist Muslim son of Sabila, he gathers the words of rap.
By God there is nothing serious in Algeria! There are no jobs and nothing!
Salam, do you know, ignorant, that Amazigh were the first who came to Morocco and North Africa. Review history. Greetings to Amazigh people.
Salam brothers. I am Fati, I like rap so much in its melody, even its words and the way it is sung. I too sing it and hope some day to be famous and become one of the best rappers. Good luck H-Kayne, Hoba Hoba spirit and Fnaire... Thank you!
Bigg, bravo ha! Fnaire are the best singers in Morocco, OK, Bigg, ha!
IZK forever and LWAC smokes cannabis
Lotfi, a fan of Wydad, I tell you WAC forever Boca Juniors.
Salam alikum. We must wait until we see the results or what Taoussi will achieve with the national team. It is just a matter of time. Rachid Taoussi is a great coach with all due respect to Badou Zaki. However, the biggest problem is the Football Federation, not Taoussi or Zaki. We should be realistic.
I am proud of the Moroccan national team. Whether it wins or loses, I like the Moroccan team. I wish it to achieve a real victory from my heart. We are always Moroccans, always proud and always KAC.
Why doesn't Rachid Taoussi call Jawad Zairi? He is quick and a good team player. He would constitute a challenge for the opponent.
The coach Taoussi sacrificed his back and the best interesting news. Therefore, the return of Badou Zaki is important for the national team.
The national team has started with a loss. But once they were achieving honourable results, the fans began calling for Zaki. In the end, Rachid Taoussi wasn't given an opportunity to train the national team.
Salam alikum. Viva Kadhafi! Go ahead! We're with you Moamer!
We wish you success in the World Cup qualifiers even if you did nothing in South Africa, God willing!
We want Zaki. Zaki is the best coach of the Moroccan team. Moreover, Nibat should go away as he was the one who opposed Zaki. Zaki, Zaki you are always in our hearts Zaki!
I wish success to the new government in spite of the problems of the people.
May God rest your soul in peace, leader!
These are our customs and traditions. It is true that it shouldn't be called a celebration, but we also shouldn't be sad or shed blood. Therefore, Achoura is a day on which alimonies are offered.
Achoura is a day for fasting and offering alimonies to bring joy to the poor. Thank you!
Happy Achoura! My greetings to Soka! Thank you everyone for souvenirs!
When will the results of the draw of 15.12.2007 be announced?
Hi! My name is Kawtar. I have project of trade development. However, there are no facilities in paperwork.
Salam. I am a young man, 21. I have the idea of a project of setting up a building business and offer an opportunity to many young people to access the job market.
By God this site is nice I should first show it to the Arabic teacher.
This is nice but wikipedia did it better.
My teacher told me this topic is very nice and I think it is very nice!
Salam everyone. I want to set up a business in the field of painting with the will and assistance of God. What should I do? Thank you.
Salam alikum. I am a small farmer from the region of Tagoudet Tonfit, Midelt. I have a small arable land. I have its titles. But it is not registered. I ask my brothers who can help if there is any way to register this land or benefit from an agricultural loan.
Salam alikum. You haven't replied to my question, I talked about plans for small farmers.
Salam alikum. What are your plans for this year because small farmers endure problems of drought this year? Will there be assistance in term of fertilisers and grains?
I am lesbian and nothing will change. Whether you accept me or not, it is your own business. Wherever you go, we are there.
1,2, 3, long live Algeria. I love Algeria so much. God willing, they will win.
Ben Ali, long live our president. All Tunisians are happy with him. Tunisia is always great, we have a good life in Tunisia courtesy of our president, Ben Ali. God willing, he will win the elections and make all Tunisians happy.
We were also sorry for his loss because he was a great star.
Thank you very much Khalifa. Algeria is not a country. Thank you: Moumen Khalifa.
This is not authentic Moroccan couscous
Islam has come in order to honor woman and restore her rights. God the Almighty ordered woman to wear hijab for her interest so that she won't be a prey for wolves who don't know God. It is hijab that protects her from the eyes of these wolves. Some women see their beauty in their nakedness. In this way they are just causing themselves problems. Therefore, alert Muslims should only raise their awareness and pray for their guidance through persuasion and not intimidation.
I am from Morocco and my opinion about the articles of Magharebia is that they are great because I am one of them.
Salam. I am Hicham, the delegate of youth of Youssoufia, branch of Yacoub Mansour. We are very happy with the development of this network.
Nass El Ghiwane is a great band. I refer to God those who put you in prison and destroyed Batma, poor man, there are enemies of God.
God bless you.
Where is it now? Have you seen ESS with the 1990's section, it is certainly 92.
My sole dream is to sing with Al Ghiwane.
May God protect Morocco from terrorism perpetuated by Algeria against its Moroccan brothers. Long live Morocco and our Algerian brothers. Death to lying, greedy generals.
There is no group like Nass El Ghiwane. I prefer them to all musicians who just roar. They are the best in the world because they say the truth not lies. The most important of this, may God rest the soul of Boujmia and Batma. May God grant good health to Aalal and Omar.
I want to wok through Anapec.
I am a young man who loves Nass El Ghiwane because their songs are expressive and criticise the tyrannical regime.
How are you Nancy, I'm Hajar from Morocco, I love so much Nancy and I wish you success and faithfulness in your job, I wish you will always be beautiful and clean, so bye, good night, bye bye Nancy
Salam alikum. Look, even girls today don't respect themselves in the way they dress and in their morals. This is not applicable to all of them. Anyway, they have gone too far. They have renounced our traditions. We no longer know whether we are in Morocco or any country which has no name. We have no religion and no faith. Now we are just following imitation, that's all, even if it drives us to some catastrophe. May God protect us! You have gone too far, o girls of Morocco, to the point that we have become a destination for sex tourism. Now you just follow money! This is very strange of you.
This would certainly happen because there are pits everywhere. The more we vote for parties, the more pits they make!
Salam. First of all, is the girl Muslim, Jewish, Christian or atheist? Democratically, who is this girl? Is it just by being Moroccan she is Muslim? Whom are you talking to and debating with? Ahh, I forgot, she was born in Morocco, her name is Moroccan so she is a Muslim.
Has Mhamed passed or not?
Honestly, I am a student in the second year of the baccalaureate. This is the first time I enter this site. I felt happy and scared. But it filled me with enthusiasm to work harder. I wish you success!
Enough fraud!
Salam Hicham Guerrouj. We love you so much. You're in our hearts. We are runners from Tiznit. We greet you with our friend Amin Grwad for this success. We want to meet you and gain your admiration in any race or sport event. Thank you.
Congratulations, Houda, on this achievement. I wish success to everyone, God willing!
Congratulations, beauty! I wish all Moroccans success! May God grant you more success! You are a source of encouragement because when I read this, I become jealous. May God protect you for your parents, oh Lord!
Salam. I hope that we have champions like Hicham El Guerrouj. I am member of Fath Inezgane club.
Enough hypocrisy! They say the system is good! Speak reasonably. The national exam is easy but you have to work to get the average passing score.
Azul to you my brother Hicham. I thank you very much. I am one of the people who love you. I hope to God to be like you in future, God willing. Kind greetings.
Congratulations Rabat, many congratulations Morocco!
Salam. I am Hassaine from Morocco. How are you. Bless you. I am a faithful friend. Thank you.
Azul Amazigh people wherever you are! I say thank you! Enough lies! Fight for Tamazight to have rights! I am Rachid Alftwaki from Lakhssass. I say thank you!
Thank you for this Amazigh channel. But you have forgotten Amazigh customs. I mean Soussi, Rifi and Zayani dresses. They are parts of the tradition. I was quite impressed, but I ask the institute to intervene because there are some programmes which need reconsideration such as the programme "Kantara" (Bridge). Amazigh men are not in Europe. There are also Amazigh players in the world, such as Hajji.
Greetings to you, dear Amazigh. We thank Tamazight channel. It is a channel which can be considered the light of all Amazigh people wherever they are. I hope you will put hand in hand until you reach what we want, God willing! Salam alikum.
Azul! I want to say something dear to me my brothers. I like Tamazight so much. Praise be to God, I am very hopeful to become a great writer in Tamazight. Pray for me!
In the name of God. I liked this site. However, there is one problem. It is how to reach these aids. We who live abroad don't know any address of an organization which helps immigrants. I hope you will give us addresses of organizations interested in such issues. Thank you!
Azul my brothers. How are you? Is everything fine? Anyway, thank you very much for this topic about Tifinagh and Tamazight. I am Azigh or Chleh, this is how we are known in Souss. I am familiar with this alphabet, praise be to God. I master them very well because I learnt them from my young sister who studies in the primary school because they teach them Tamazight. Finally, viva Amazigh people of the whole world!
Nancy Fear your Lord and repent. Your fame or beauty will not help you. Your devout worship of the Lord will when you are asked in your grave. What will your answers be to your Lord. Please think about this rather than distracting people!
In the name of God, I wish everyone quick recovery God willing! Advice from me to you, remember God a lot and be patient, just follow the example our master Jacob, peace of God be upon him, Muslims.
Please, I would like to know symptoms of cancer. The right side of my breast and the left side of my neck hurt me. I have high temperatures from time to time. I am 22. I hail from a poor family. My father is dead. I apologise. Thank you.
Peace, mercy and blessings of God be upon you. My mother had this malign disease in bones. She is currently under treatment with chemotherapy. I wonder if she will recover. Please reply as soon as possible! I am very scared for my dear mother. Thank you!
There is no other God but God, Mohamed is the messenger of God. I am a girl, I am forty, I have breast cancer. I come from a very poor family. I am single. I have a brother and a sister. No one provides for us. Our mother died, may God rest her soul. Our father is an old man. I address a call to all benefactors to help me in treatment fees which are very high and costly. I hail from the city of Larache. I can't afford the fees. Please help me or guide me to a humanitarian association or branches of the association Lalla Salma. God doesn't waste the reward of benefactors. May God reward you with all the good! Peace, mercy and blessings of God be upon you. Have mercy on those on earth and God will have mercy on you, amen!
By God, anyone who sees suffering of others forgets their own suffering! My mother was affected by that disease. Thank God, she had a surgery of mastectomy. She is still under treatment. May God not deprive anyone of their parents because it is not easy to see them suffering. May God heal all Muslims! I hope there will be encouraging and awareness programmes about this disease. Associations active in the field should expand their action. I say to all patients who have this disease that they should be optimistic because the psychological side plays an important role in healing, God willing! O Lord heal all Muslim women and men!
I wish recovery from God to all Moroccans!
Salam. My name is Fatima. My aunt has breast cancer. She was diagnosed here in Tétouan and was sent to Moulay Ben Abdellah in Rabat. There, procedures are late. People there are neglected. Poor people, they sleep in the garden. According to my aunt, they didn't want to give her a bed. They told her to pay 1000 dirhams first in order to take a bed. Everything there is achieved through bribery. Still Morocco wants to make progress! I want my message to reach officials in charge of this.
In the name of God. When God creates a disease, He creates a treatment for it. There is no cure except from God, who spread the earth and lift the sky in six days. Exalted be God, He has every hope and all the good. As I am commenting on this disease, me too I have a sister who is suffering from this disease. Diagnosis was somehow late. Praise be to God for His mercy and nobleness. The only thing I would like to say about this is that I wish quick recovery to my sister who is weak and worshiping God. From Mohamed to all the worshiping servants of God, I wish you quick recovery from God. Peace and blessings of God be upon our master Mohamed, his family and companions.
Exalted be God, may God guide subjects of God and bring them back to the right path!
Salam alikum. I read everything written. Honestly, there are some who took the bac through cheating and don't deserve it. Those who are lucky pass; but this doesn't prevent us from working hard, study, concentrate and avoid cheating. I personally don't want to take the bac through cheating.
I am from Rabat. Honestly, I think they are all right. We the people of Rabat don't have the necessary grade in the regional exam even if we have worked seriously however, God is the greatest. Reply to me.
Salam alikum. I am your brother Oussama. I face a problem. It is the baccalaureate certificate. I would like to know why whenever I meet a Moroccan and ask him about the baccalaureate exam, he replies negatively.
May God release them; prison is death.
Work hard in the regional exam.
Brothers, the problem is with the students. I study in the baccalaureate. The teacher does more than his efforts but students, honestly, don't want to study. They want to pass without making any effort. By God this is a shame. You find Morocco underdeveloped in everything. We are just good in spying and scrutinizing.
Shame on them. Is this justice for them? They must try those monsters who raped her. Their judgment is founded on no religion or Islam. His destiny is to hell. Amen.
What a catastrophe! This is an injustice.
There is no power and no will but from God. This is all I have to say, nothing more.
I say that the Moroccan coach shouldn't lose hope. I hope that Atlas lions will restore their previous position.
I ask God the Almighty to grant success to the national team.
Shame on them, she wasn't at fault. If she were one of their daughters, would they accept that she be stoned? These people are without mercy. Their fate is to hell. God does not accept killers of souls.
Unfortunately we no longer have a team we can rely on.
I hope to pass!
Thank you for this nice site, I hope that you'll add some information about driving techniques and the explanation of road signs, thanks. Bye bye bye...
Salam, how are you, we thank you so much for this valuable information you offer us and for your great efforts you make, and thank you for offering us an opportunity to write about our opinions.
Salam. I am a young girl in the second year of baccalaureate studies. I got 10.06 in the first term and 10.55 in the regional exam. I hope that you will guide me to a branch which has many outlets in the future because I am very confused in the face of so many branches.
I am a student in the baccalaureate sciences. I would like to succeed in my studies but I don't have necessary means. Please I want a solution from you. Thank you.
Salam alikum. Sorry, I write Arabic in French characters. I don't have Arabic characters in my laptop. I would like to reply to Zahra, the girl who wants to invite a Palestinian young man. You to a public redactor, type the letter in the name of your father or brother, who owns the house. You take it to the local authority, authenticate the signature with your father. You write your name and send it to the embassy. You have to mention the number of your ID, the address, as well as the ID of your father, his job. May God assist you! You can sent it to the embassy by fax or fax it to your fiancé. After all this, you can wish good luck. May God preserve our dear country Morocco, grant long life to our king Mohamed 6, king of humanity! May God help you and help everyone!
Stay away from our Lord o Arabs, reconcile between yourselves, it is none of your business!
All of you are guardians and every guardian is responsible for his subjects.
The tyrant is dead. Praise be to God for His grace to all Muslims. Libya is free and will become free. God is the Greatest! I am Moroccan and love Libya so much.
I am a Moroccan woman. I want to marry a Palestinian. Is there a solution?
I am a fan of Wydad of Casablanca. Always in the leadership. Always with you. I live abroad in France.
Hi. I am Younes from Erriachidia. I am a Raja fan to...I wish success to Raja and that it continues its prominence. Raja forever.
I'm Sanae Mintarae from the city of El Mohamadia, I'm 21 years old. I also thank Maghreb star academy which has made the dream of Hajar come true, I want to tell her that I love her so much and thank you, I love you Hajar.
We want to join the Royal Federation of Rugby. We are the team of Ain Louh for rugby.
Hi everyone! By God, if possible, show us everything in order to see how the hearing was closed. I have something to say. Thank you! Ghazi from Finland.
Salam. I am a student in the baccalaureate. Honestly, this year the exam was accessible especially for arts students except the subject of history and geography. It was somehow tough as they have given a map. May God grant success to everyone, oh Lord. Amen.
A popular proverb says "In each delay there is something good".
I like Hajar madly, Kawtar and Yosra so much and wish more success to Nesma and hope that they broadcast star academy 24/24 and bring us the star Jannat, I thank you so much for this channel thanks
Antique.
These aren't stadiums with international standards. These are just garbage!
Is true that Polisario is no longer part of the Arab Maghreb Union?
The problem with us sons of dustmen is ours, because we don't claim our rights.
I would like to say something, enough with events in Tunisia. Now, why do they keep on saying we will make job openings for you? They have done nothing for us. I haven't seen any change in Tunisia. I am an individual who likes to work and provide for myself. I am looking for a job. I hope you will find me a job as soon as possible. This is what I have previously said, I have nothing to say more.
God's curse on you!
Americans have produced this film about the messenger of God, peace and blessings of God be upon him. They made this film to distract us so that they could do what they want to Arabs and thus we remain distracted with the film and they would do what they want in war. These statements are obscene.
Islam is the religion of the world. It can't be destroyed because it is the religion of the whole world.
Peace and blessings of God be upon the prophet. If you pray for his blessings, you love him.
There is no other God but Allah, Mohamed is the messenger of God. Shame on them for being this disrespectful to the prophet, peace and blessings of God be upon him. Salam. Shame on you!
Since we are sleeping, Jews are doing to us what they want. Since we are not reacting or they have silenced us about this base act, they have reached their goal. So, God suffices me and He is the best disposer of affairs. We can only say this about these calamities without reacting.
I love her so much.
O people, there is something you forgot that actions speak louder. A salutation to the Algerian customs! May God help us, God willing! You are talking about corruption, hhhh! This is because it wasn't you who were threatened by arms on your head and told you choose between 10000000000 Algerian dinars or a bullet! In both cases, they will move ahead???!!!
Salam alikum. May God help Algerian customs!
Yes, you are lazy and don't want to study! You should all have a score of 18.20 this year, ha!
Hi! I would like to know when the customs' entry exam will be held. Moreover, I need a phone number to get more information.
Hey guys, wish me good luck with the master's degree, God willing!
I am a fan.
We hope that the Moroccan federation will reconsider Zaki to train the Moroccan national team.
I want a reply. Why doesn't the western world visit Magharebia site?
All young girls should respect others because this is a shame for Muslims and Arabs. How can a young girl uncover her body in front of everyone? Salafis are right. Moreover, how can these men defend her? Even if she doesn't wear the veil, she should be respectable. To that individual who talked about a Tunisian girl, I would like to tell him this is not a measure. How can you encourage your mother or sister to do such a thing and hate a woman to be covered and prefer nakedness? Honestly, if manhood is not defended by people like Salafis, it will be lost for many Arabs.
Enjoy your fast-breaking.
What can I say? It is a pity you didn't take the star. Even without it you're a star with your voice and feelings noticed by everyone. May God assist you in this way.
No and no to denigrating our dear messenger. We will rise to defend him in this life before the afterlife. No and no!
The nicest Bassma in the whole world. Bassma, even if you don't take the title you are in our hearts a star and we will never forget you.
Denigration of the messenger, peace and blessings of God be upon him, is considered heart-breaking for every Muslim. Therefore, we have as followers of Mohamed to change this vice as much as we can. We recall the hadith of the prophet to change this vice. The messenger, peace and blessings of God be upon him, "Fight with your money and souls for the cause of God, this is better for you if you know."
Bassma the star, God willing, the star.
I love you Bassma. You deserve the title of the star. I hope you will take it because you have a great voice, God bless you, you're nice and Moroccans to death. It is you now who represents Morocco. Good luck darling.
Salam alikum. I address you my problem. I want to register in training in Yassmina Mohamadia but I am in Italy, I can't
Salam. I am a mechanic. I want to get a diploma because a company called me and told me I don't have a diploma, it is useless. I want some information before I miss the opportunity. Thank you!
I want to register in vocational training but don't know what to do. I want advice.
Thank you, vocational training!
I am Sarah from the city of Rabat. I am 19. God didn't grant me success in the bac. I want to do vocational training. But I don't know what to choose. Honestly, I want some advice from you.
Salam. I've studied up to the baccalaureate level. I want to study informatics. Can you help me with your advice? Thank you!
Hi. I am from Italy. I will marry in August but haven't found any acceptable Negafa (a woman who assists the bride in Morocco in dressing). Can you help me?
My warmest condolences to the families of the victims of the Casablanca attacks.
I love the Moroccan Caftan. Thank you.
Terrorism threatens all of humanity and the cause of its emergence is the absence of equality and freedom… This is what pushed these suicide bombers to express themselves in such an exceptional way. This is saddening our Islamic community, which calls for high values. Our honourable Prophet forbade us to kill a soul without the right to do so. This shows that we are a nation that doesn't like wars, for while they say we are the heart of terrorism, it is the opposite - we don't accept these acts.
I want Khayri's song "Rah Thla Otzman Rah Lkhir o Rah Chan" please.
I am not against individual freedom. However, everyone must know that individual freedom has its limits when it becomes harmful for the other. But if we don't make limits for it, just imagine that everyone does what he wants. Girls will be naked on the streets and boys as well. Drinking alcohol and drugs will be taken openly. O creatures of God, don't you read the Qur'an or you read it and don't know what it says or you know but you don't believe in it? O creatures of God, fear God! O sirs, this is a new era but, but religion is compliant with these times. The best example are the scientific miracles of the Qur'an. The clothes which show the adornments of women excites the instincts of men. Anyone who says something different, I doubt his manliness because he is sick. This is because the thing that makes the male organ erect is seeing something exciting of the body of the woman. This is what makes the heart pump blood abundantly which makes the male organ erect. This was confirmed by science. Clothes of woman excite man. We don't have a button which we click to be excited whenever we want. I will tell you something else. This is a correct hadith, you can make sure about it. The prophet, peace and blessings of God be upon him, was sitting with his companions, may God be pleased with them, a man came in, he said to the prophet of God "allow me to commit adultery". All the companions stood up. But look at what the prophet did. He made the man sit next to him and asked him five questions: "Do you accept it for your mother?" He said "No, I will sacrifice my mother and father for you". "Will you accept it for your daughter?" "No, I will sacrifice my mother and father for you". "For your wife or aunt?" And the man kept on saying no, I will sacrifice my mother and father for you. So the man changed his mind, repented and asked God's forgiveness. My brothers, if you have in your hearts some conviction, advise your brothers, children and parents. Is there anyone who accepts for his sister, daughter, mother, aunt or other girls humiliation? Your opinion is welcome!
here is my msn Hajar.
I am Sofia. I love so much Cheb Bilal. He is the best, by God. His songs are all great. No one will be like him. May God protect Cheb Bilal for us.
Rai without Tadj Eldine Ainousse, may God rest his soul, isn't rai. May God rest your soul Taj.
Salam. I love Bilal.
hahahahahaha
Ohhh we love u Saida Fikri. Our Tawnati girl, always pride, military forever.
Asala Asala Asala the star.
Anyway, wherever you go there are beautiful and bad things. Everyone chooses his own way in the way he sees it. I am a Moroccan woman. I am proud of it. I'm from Marrakech. I am 34, unmarried. Marriage is just fate. If a man comes, it's OK. If he doesn't, I am with my parents. Praise be to God, I take care of them. This is enough. Anyone just wants a good pious man who fears God. Salam.
I am a Moroccan girl and love my country so much. therefore, I like all Arab countries. We are all Muslims and brothers. I thank everyone who says a word of praise about Morocco.
Everything is good!
Very great!
The fair is great.
I'm Mbark Lkhouch I like Gnawa namely Hamid Lksri and Zhra Ajakka long live Nknafa Takandot Aziz Alkagh bye bye bye
nice festival, by God it's nice I'm just waiting when it'll arrive
It is a shame on Salafis to do this. This is a shame. What is going on?
Salam alaikoum, I say in this regard that Islam disowns such terrorist attacks. God doesn't accept killing innocents and forbid killing a soul without any right. May God punish the oppressors and criminals. May God welcome those killed in His wide paradise and forgive them, grant their families patience. For God we are and to God we shall return. Oh Lord liberate the beloved Algeria, for whom a million and half a million martyrs died, from the killers and criminals, oh Lord make Islam and Muslims victorious. Salam.
The support of God is coming, those who pretend to be Muslims don't have the right to hold arms against their brothers, even if they're rebels in order to avoid fitna.
it's ok not very good
The best thing I read I wish more things that inform us about Morocco
very good
that's really very poor
May God help you! You are fighting for a loaf of bread. There is nothing, all these are lies! Do you hear, it is not question of Islam or urbanization, they only want money. Greetings to you!
We don't want the border between Algeria and Morocco to be opened. We don't want their friendship. Algeria doesn't take Morocco into consideration. I hate Morocco and all the Arabs, except the sister Tunisia.
I love you Tasiwant so much!
Our dear messenger.
Salam. When will Imilchil festival begin?
Welcome to all Amazigh people in the Maghreb.
By God the Greatest, Moroccans don't know what is going on in the country. Everything is manipulated by the government as it wants. But we are watching and don't have what to eat. So we want to immigrate illegally but they closed the door of Harga. Algeria is closing its doors to us and we have nowhere to go. I want to explain to you the saying "The tar of my country is better than honey of other peoples' countries". I say the tar of other peoples' countries is better than the honey of my country. They made us hate our country. We sue them to God. Where are you media of Morocco? Go see what goes on in Khouribga, the richest city in Morocco, and it is starving. All its people have immigrated illegally. They say God will provide for them. Be sure that a big tumult will happen in Morocco as a result of their acts to us. Where are you media of Morocco? Can't you see or are you with them? Have you ever seen someone living in a villa over 10 kilometres while others in shantytowns, 20 people in a slum? Just compare! But whom I am narrating to? We thank our king Mohamed VI, he alone does projects for us. He is a better king but the dogs didn't let him be merciful to us. May God assist our king. This king is like Mohamed B, when he will die, people will commit suicide on the detriment of...May God assist our king.
Hi Rabie. You are really a great star. I wish you success.
I am Houda from Sidi Kacem. I really like the famous artist Rabie El Kati. He has his special talent in playing the role of actor who lives with the story. He is handsome and attractive. I tell you Rabie I like your personality and nice look. I wish you success. I offer you the Spanish song "a puro dolor".
I am fascinated by your role in the film "Farah Saghir". I love you because you are from Taza and my best friend live next to you. I don't know if this is authorised or not.
Al Qaeda, Al Zawahiri, Droukdel and Laouar are criminals. They have distorted the image of Islam and Muslims. They kill innocent people. They are bandits. Woe you from the most powerful, greatest most revengeful! O terrorists, the national Algerian army will kill you and eliminate you!
Immigration to Morocco, a suitable and great house.
I'm a student in the second year of the baccalaureate science VT. Now I'm waiting for results. But I don't know what to do after the bac. Please brothers, if you have any advice or anything, help me! May God grant success to everyone!
Hi! What can I say? Good luck everyone! Next year I will be in the bac year. I study PC sciences. I hope to get honours in order to study in military schools because they are the best choice in my opinion. Thank you!
I have an idea. For people who passed the bac without honours, they can study pharmacy for example in Ukraine. Once you complete your studies for four years, they authorize to open a pharmacy and give you a car. There is a second solution. You can become a nurse in a school in Fès. You study for three years, then you work. Many people I know did this and it worked. I have other ideas. I can advise anyone who wants to study after the bac. If anyone wants to do anything of these, I will tell them. Just write me via this site. Bye!
I passed the baccalaureate without honours. Is there any school or institute where I can do my graduate studies (apart from a university)?
I'm Siham. I passed the bac, but I don't know what to do. I want some prospects for art students.
My greetings to you all namely Hajar who sang very well and Ahmed I like him so much and wish to meet him
Salam. I am Fatima, I study, when I was studying in the fourth year of the lower secondary, I had 11 in the regional exam and 15.96 in the class exam. Now I study in the first year of the secondary. I chose a scientific subject. I found a lot of difficulty in mathematics unlike other subjects. Now I hope you will advise me whether to keep on studying this subject or not.
I study in the third year of the lower secondary. I would like to study a technological subject. Can I choose this subject although I am not good at physics but I am very good at mathematics? What can I do? Thank you!
Salam my brothers. I am a student from Casablanca. I am finishing my secondary education this year, 2012. I want a suggestion from you. I chose the subject of science but I am not good in mathematics, physics or sciences.
I chose a scientific subject to sit for the baccalaureate exam God willing. I would like to know the grade I need to join the government.
Salam alikum. I am a student. I study in "Jidae Moushtak". I want you to guide me to orientations for the next year. So, don't disappoint me!
Educators in ISTA-IE haven't yet been paid; this is a shame on you.
Salam. Hajar won and she didn't have a good voice, zero, it is Hamid who should win but unfortunately even if he left and didn't win, you won.
I like Hajar so much because she won.
Long life, WAC forever.
Hi, happy Eid.
Salam. How are you, well? Congratulations, FAR forever, forever, FAR, always a military championship 2008/2009.
Hi Hajar, oh if you were near me.
I love Hajar.
FAR forever, long live FAR.

God is the greatest above the plots of aggressors! Viva the Mujahid Moamer Kadhafi! May God rest his soul in peace!
Salam. Thank you for all this! I would like to know something about growing poultry in Morocco as I want to build a facility for growing poultry and I need information about this, may God reward you with all the good! Thank you once more!
This is a great topic.
The best thing is one should play football if he loves it so much and play very good or not play.
Peace be upon you.
I would like to say to the woman who said close the door and give the keys to the owner that the river is just drop by drop to fill and I encourage Hajar, Ahmed, Farah and Badrou I love you to death may God protect you and I add even Soraya, Yousra, and Jamal
These articles are harsh. The Moroccan has paid. I am sad at this. Morocco is very sad. I ask all developed countries to reward Moroccans. We are lost, please consider our situation!
Thank you for this site. It is very nice, by God. Thank you, thank you.
Hajar how are you we support you a lot Hajar Errachidia
This topic lacks many important points. Please tackle them. God grants success.

We are Muslims. You can't defeat us.
I would like to know any right for woman who is victim of domestic violence and battery. She has no children because of him although he knows he was sterile even before marriage. Is there a solution?
I receive threats from a young man because I refuse to give in to his sexual desire. He took my pictures from the facebook and wants to distort them in order to send them in the place where I work and my home. I met this young man in a summer camp. He used to harass me all the time in the camp. But I didn't respond to his wish. Now he threatens me of defaming me at work and with my friends. Honestly, I don't know what to do. Whether I should go to report him to the police or not. I hope you will reply and offer me a solution. Thank you!
Salam alikum. I want the phone number of a human rights association in Casablanca.

The best player in the world.
My dear brother, peace of God be upon you.
Morocco forever!
This is a shame, you haven't provided any adequate or any information about Ouarzazate. This is a real shame. However, your work is honourable and you work for the realization of the will of the nation.
We thank the technical institutes for what they offer to the Moroccan youth we also want to know more about the rights of trainees. Salam
Salam. This is really serious. Moreover, we are not reacting to them. It is normal that we protest. Denigrating the messenger Mohamed, peace and blessings of God be upon him, isn't something insignificant. If it concerned them, it would have been ruined, they would have added moustache to her. Anyway, the most important thing is that the messenger is very dear to our hearts.
You think it is Kadhafi? Viva Kadhafi! God will make you pay for it o…
I am against this. May God guide His creatures, say amen!
Shame on you! It is as if Libya was not willing to do so!
May God rest her soul in peace!
I thank all those who transmit information with transparency and credibility, and I tell you we encourage you and God bless you. Thank you, with greetings from Mohamed.
I personally wish to fight this.
I love Nass El Ghiwane namely their album 'Nahla'. Thank you Nass El Ghiwane.

Nothing to do with reality! Sorry, this is very boring!
How are you Fnaire? Are you ok? I am from Banque Populaire.

All I want to say is God's curse on you to the Day of Judgement! Farah from Agadir.
I am a student in the second year of the baccalaureate in PC. I hope you will tell me what I can do if possible after the baccalaureate. Is it possible to do engineering God willing? What is the score I should have in order to register in these schools? Thank you very much!
Sahara is Moroccan + Sahara belongs to Amazigh people and not Arabs so as to be entitled to organize referendum.
In the name of God the Beneficent the Merciful. My brothers and sisters, peace, mercy and blessings of God be upon you. Whether you are from Morocco or any other country, if you speak Arabic and are Muslim, we are brothers and will remain brothers to the last moment. I hope you understand what I say. Thank you!
The nicest and cleanest driving school with the testimony of everyone is 3Imane Wa Houda school for driving. It is directed by the respectable Malika Driss. The school is located in the district of Bousaada, province of Msila. God is witness to what I say.
I married in 2008. I have one daughter, she is 21 months. I am now pregnant with twins in the seventh month with my husband who is my cousin. I live in the city of Temara. I live far away from my family and far away from his family. I want a solution because my husband deserted me although we live in the same house. I suffer a lot because he treats me severely without beating me because he has signed a commitment not to beat me. However, he treats me aggressively and despicably. He causes me moral and material prejudice. What is the solution?
Salam my brothers. I asked a question two days ago and two days I found my question posted. However, I haven't found any reply. Please reply. May God reward you.
I support Ennahda movement. I will support you to the end. God willing, you will take part in politics in Tunisia.
I love Haifa to death. When I listen to her songs, I am amused, and I contemplate her beauty.
Great work! It is really useful for everyone. Bright idea from Mr. Samir Chandoul. May you be successful Samir!
I am Yassin from Tetouan. I am unemployed and want a job in anything. I want you to help me please. Thank you very much. Salam.
We have no comment.
The Moroccan press endures a problem. It is the attempt to attract readers through publishing false news which don't exist. May God heal our master Mohamed VI.
I love you Hind, you're a great artist.
I love you.
You're great.
I want to know how much I have in my account.
Hind Sabri you're the best star.
I am Abdellah. I live in Spain. I want to start a project in Morocco of raising poultry and rabbits. Is there any help?
I am a Moroccan young man, 18. I would like to start my life. I hope you will help me.
Salam, people are dying and you write, is there any use of that.
I'm a citizen of Tunisia. And I agree to the presence of such activities now in the Arab Maghreb as they will contribute to the change of political conditions reconcile powers and unite the Arab people and also return to religion.
Salam. I am a Moroccan young girl, 24. I want to open a kindergarten and want to get information about how to carry out this project. Thank you very much! Please reply as soon as possible!
What now? The poor aren't considered. I say that there are talents only in popular neighbourhoods. Take a tour and you will see!
Salam alikum. I am from Berkane. I am 32. I am a welder. I need help to expand the project of my business.
Salam. I want a loan to set up a business to export olive oil to Europe.
Salam, how are you, we want more.
Salam, to all the dear ones in the love of God and the honorable prophet, yes one word unites us, but there are unfortunately many movements, so how can the Zionists not make prey of us? Al Qaeda is an American film with Israeli direction, as to the scenery, it's British and the viewer is Arab.
Thank you.
Salam alikum. I am a married young man. I need your help to set up a business in cotton manufacture
I think that all attempts made by the terrorists are failed attempts.
True you're all thieves.
Forever, forever our country.
May God help you Mr Abdalilah against the corrupt.
You're the nicest child I know, do you accept to be my friend.
I'm Soufiane from the capital, we love Chab Nasro so much, we're the sons of the capital and he's the only singer whom we listen to and who has any influence on us so much. 'Ana Wnti W Dahr Twil' (Me and you and life is long).
I love Cheb Nasro.
In 2004, the Egyptian stopped the heart, in 2009 it reached its limit.
I agree with this comment. However, we shouldn't forget that people play an important role in this issue. For example, we notice that famous proverbs in our country are all triggered by fear. For example, walk from wall to wall and don't be afraid. There are many other similar proverbs. However, if we want to change this homeland, we must change ourselves firstly because God says "Indeed, Allah will not change the condition of a people until they change what is in themselves". Therefore, we have to do it.
I study in the second year of the baccalaureate, human sciences in Sidi Ifni. I wish success in the exam. I also wish success to all the students God willing. We also hope the exam will be easy, god willing. With wishes of success.
Salam. How are you? I thank all the teachers who assist us well. I hope that the exam will be accessible. Even if we study hard, fear is inevitable. I don't agree with the pupil who want them to remove the mock exam. No, keep it because it will help us well even of we specialize in science. But it is important to keep it. This is my opinion. Thank you very much.
Look, you just have to study hard and relax. It is just the stupid who say the exam is very hard. So concentrate. We will only see what God imparted on us. Good luck.
I wish success to Nessma in Maghreb star academy, I love you Hajar.
Salam alikum. I am in 2Bsh2. I thank everyone and wish success to all of us.
The exams are difficult and teachers are incompetent. They haven't even finished the programme. Pupils have to take the exam.
Congratulations Hajar, I liked you and hoped you would win.
Hi. Honestly, up to now, he is the best Moroccan team who has national spirit, who is concerned about the national jersey , the Moroccan flag and who had a dream to win the African cup, anyway, God suffices me and He is the best mandate against those who were the cause! I hope from God the Almighty that he returns to the Moroccan national team. Please, Badou Zaki, in my name and in the name of all Moroccans!
Badoooo Zakiiiiiii!
I love you Aicha as long as you love Nasrou. I am a big fan of him. There is a probability that I would love you. Thanks Nabil .
Salam. There is just one word I want to say. Our national team is good.
Salam alikum. I hail from the town of Ksar El Kebir. I tell you that Badou Zaki will return to the national team whether they win or lose, God willing!
I am a Moroccan man. I hope that Atlas Lions will restore their prestige. I am sure Lions will be present in Brazil 2014.
I want Mohamad Fakhir. Zaki should be less selfish then he can train the national team. The national team doesn't belong to Zaki. All Morocco loves Zaki and they will never forget the achievement of 2004.
I love the Moroccan national team. I thank all players of the national team who were at the top in front of Algeria. That day 04/06/2011 was the day of happiness, that day I was very happy. I hope they will make us even happier. 1, 2, 3, 4 Morocco is stronger!
May God protect our country.
I say to Bouteflika you're the biggest terrorist in the world. If I were ruling the world I would have put you in a refrigerator! Sahara is Moroccan and will remain Moroccan God willing!
Salam. I would like to set up a business. I would like to know if there are milk cooperatives in the city of Al Hoceima. I have 3 hectares and water is available. I would like to grow 5 milk cows. I want you to tell me if the project will succeed or not.
Salam alikum. I am a young man from the city of Azilal. I want to get an adequate loan.
We shouldn't give any opportunity to dissidents to achieve the ambition of Algeria to get an outlet to the Atlantic Ocean.
Thank you Mhdal Halwi for this information!
I have the idea of an agricultural project. It consists in planting a hectare of banana. I already have a well and equipped pump. I want help to set up this project. Salam. Amazirh Abdelali Houara.
Thank you very much!
I've liked this poet since I was young.
Hi. I am Brahim from Haj Kador, region of Meknes. I have a parcel of land and want to set up an agricultural enterprise and cattle growing. I want the help of young people who studied in vocational training centres in managing this business.
I am a young man who is 24. I want to set up a business of poultry even if I am in a rural zone. I have a parcel of land with an area of 3 hectares but I know nothing about Moukawalati.
Salam alikum. This is a nice topic. In reality we have an agricultural land in the city of Ain Taoujdat in the region of Meknes. I want please information about agriculture. Thank you.
Just lies, thare are girls' centres in Targuist. People need work to flee unemployment. There's a women club of the Youth and Sport, a pilot centre of Health, there's a youth centre, a women centre of the National Cooperation, so we don't need more, heheheh
Salam. I am Rachid from Madrid. In Morocco, the government accepts this way of dressing and punishes anyone who intervenes about this issue. O Lord this is enormous, my dear country! O Lord support our Muslim brothers who are against this enormous act!
I support the freedom of the individual but within limits. I support this group which you dubbed extremists and Salafists. However, if the girl of Rabat has respected herself, they wouldn't have assaulted her.
Salam. I hope that the Moroccan associations will stand in front of the oppression of Moroccan institutes because they are still longing for the era of "oppression and humiliation". So it is high time that they wake up, this is the era of Mohamed 6.
May God reward you for your job.
I wish you a nice future. I wish you success as well in the service of Morocco and do a lot for it God willing!
I don't like Raja.
I am Adil Alwardi. I love Siham...
Larsaad forever.
Talbi Azzaddene, Nas El Ghiwan are men and they told the truth. They wanted to raise your awareness and you brought your drums.
I'm one of the people who are fond of Nass El Ghiwane; my greetings to members of the group. May God rest the souls of Bojmi who died under the hands of Hassan II and also Baarob, may God rest their souls.
I really love Nass El Ghiwane because it is an old group in Morocco. Listen to what I'm going to say… Where's Batma and where's Boujmia? Omar and Allal are still living, Pako is fighting death. Glory be to God who changes conditions, who separated Nass El Ghiwane. Who could have imagined that Bojmi would die betrayed, who could have imagined that Batma will go distressed, oh my sorrows, and why are the drums sad, oh my sorrows, and please don't forget us… I wish you happiness with El Ghiwane.
I consider Nass El Ghiwane stars in the Moroccan sky. Nass El Ghiwane united people, they sacrificed their lives for Moroccans 1957 I can't describe these people. Anyway, Omar Sayed is my father's friend: p
God's curse on those who have no shame!
Unfortunately we see such acts. We are a Muslim country. There is no power and no will but from God.
I am one of the fans of Hicham! Pride to you, bravo, bravo!
I am a runner from the town of M'diq. I love you so much Hicham. Sohayb, 16.
I will beat the record of Hicham El Guerrouj in 3'23'00
May God reward you my brother Hicham for all the victories you offered to this dear country. I advise you and myself to be pious to God. I advise you like a brother to be close to the poor and help them as much as you can. Forgive me if I was daring my brother.
I love athletics.
I love you so much. I would like to be a runner like you God willing!
Salam, I'm Sara from Morocco I want to thank you for this topic about Amazigh language as I'm Amazigh and despite the fact that I'm Berber I find difficulty in writing in tifinagh, thanks.
I am an Amazigh from Morocco. I would like to thank you very much for the subject. I pray for you. I suggest that the letters of Amazighi language are standardised so that it becomes easy to learn. Thank you.
I'm in Tiznit the home of Amazigh people my warmest greetings to you
Greetings to you, my brothers and sisters- wishing you wellness and a warm greeting too. I just have one question: Is Tamazight one? I mean how it is spoken? Is it ours which is spoken or what, because some say it is Tarifit while others say it is Mazight. I checked in the book abc for learning Tamazight language, but I don't know, where there be not tumult even if the Amazigh people is a democratic nation, the nation of free people. Hamid from Marrakech. A warm greeting, Amazigh forever.
God's curse on liars!
I would like to ask if it is possible for someone who has 18 to be enlisted in the army and join it.
My greeting to the prominent Moroccan artist. I love the song "Ya Mina Bislama" (Goodbye Mina).
Men are too covetous!
A great artist, may God rest his soul in peace!
I would like to marry. I work in France. I came to Morocco on holidays. If you want me, here is my phone number.
Why not?
This is injustice against this young girl. They should have stoned the people who committed the crime of rape against her. There is no power and no will but from God.
I seek refuge with God and He suffices me.
good it's verry good
He is a dog, a donkey and is just killing a lot of people. However, he was killed. Those who killed him didn't do something big.
The pupils are always humiliated and some teachers humiliate them. There are no equal opportunities because some teachers put a difficult exam, tighten the control and even correction. But they forget that pressure, numerous subjects and fear make you forget all your lessons.
How can the pupil sit for the exam if he hasn't studied anything in the quarter?
I didn't benefit at all from this forum. I passed the baccalaureate in 2012. I still can't take any orientation. I haven't chosen any subject yet.
I have studied humanities. I passed this year and don't know what to do next.
I wish success to everyone who worked hard so that they will get the bac, with wishes of success God willing.
Salam everyone. I am scared, by God, about the results. They will be announced in one week. I had low grades in the regional exam and I am scared unless I don't pass. Please pray for me and for all pupils. Thank you my dear students and to this site. Salam alikum. May God grant you success, God willing.
My brothers, there is no credibility and no transparency. I am here in my country, there is real chaos in baccalaureate classes. Many were bribed with money. So how do you want this transparency to be? Law is implemented only for the poor and weak.
Salam alikum. If only the baccalaureate were without distinction. We see that most students study well but get 10, 11 or 12. Therefore, they are deprived of schools they were aspiring to. Why do students work hard but in the end they get 10 and are forgotten, why?
Algeria + Morocco always together, I'm Algerian and I love Morocco because they're men like the Algerians.
You have killed us with words. You think Morocco will be reformed when you adopt this new law? I don't think so. You have implemented this law, we agree with you. But first you should repair the roads, or are these mere words, words? We criticise our times, but the defect is in us and the only defect of our times is us.
It's a shame, Mr Karim Ghalab, about this law. There are drivers who provide for a tribe! If this law were applied to this driver, what would be the fate of his family? They'll be out on the streets and depravity will spread in the country. You have all consideration.
Your excellency the minister, this law is in favour of the royal gendarmes and the police. It will increase bribery and corruption. It is not in the interests of the citizen. The Highway Code is implemented only on paper.
I would like to know the fines applied for every offense, OK? This is important, because I have research to do.
We are with you minister but we don't want manipulation of law by security officers, more bribery than before and roads should be upgraded.
I would like to join Golden Foot. I hope this is possible.
Is it possible for the above-mentioned person who has a certificate of the lower secondary to get an interest-free loan from Mokawalati programme to set up a construction business? He's currently doing this informally.
I am 16. I would like to participate in Golden Foot competition. But I don't know what to bring in order to register. Thank you!
I agree.
I am a Moroccan young girl. I am 25. I want to set up a project in dressmaking. I have a diploma in traditional and modern design. Please accept my request to help me. Thank you!
Kadhafi died and left it behind him one thousand like Kadhafi! May God help you Libyans!
I don't say this is not true. I just say that Moroccans carried out an attack in Casablanca in 2003. As investigators said, the attack was carried out by Palestinians. But we can't say that the police is lying. But … The square is Buzzing with life. Tangier 6012.
I hail from Algeria. I am Zino. Praise be to God, colonel Kadhafi is dead. We Algerians share your joy.
Azul. Tribute to Sekat Mohamed born in Tixaraine.
I am a young girl, 23. I have a diploma in international cuisine and working location. I would like to develop my skills in a professional way by setting up a business. I will need help.
I really love Jamal and he is very active, I greet Hajar, Yousra and Khairi, I love you all frankly, I want to contribute with what I can, ok, I love you Khairi, Hajar, Yousra, Suraya, Jamal and Khairi I love you all
Long live Antar Yahia and Karim Ziani! I love you so much!
Salam, one thing I can't understand are they students or pupils you call them pupils, thanks
Long live hamid you're honouring the north you've a great personality
This king needs a real revolt. The problem of us Moroccan people is that we don't reach an agreement. If we had agreed, we would have toppled him. What to do now? It is the right of the people in inland areas to work. Sahrawi people are receiving money although they haven't studied. He spends the month lazily and in the end he goes to get an allowance of 30 or 25. So nice! But this is good for him! They scare him with arms of Algeria. But what can we do? We must be patient.
Hi, you've turned out to be the opposite of what was expected everyone is playing on hypocrisy everyone is only concerned about himself it's really a pity
Everything is possible.
This article is nice. I like it.
There is no other God but Allah, Mohamed is the messenger of God.
God is the greatest, Mohammed is our prophet.
I am not ready to see a shame like last year, I don't want, as a Moroccan I feel that Karoui hates Moroccans and makes discriminations.
I want to particpate.
Is it possible for Asma Bassit to participate in Star Academy Maghreb? Her voice is nice.
If there are more productions of Star Academy Maghreb, it will attain world fame because we have great talent and we can sing in all the dialects of the world. Our songs, including Rai an other genres, are international. They should bring us famous stars from the west and east. And if only they would bring Tamer Hosni and Reda Taliani. Please when are you going to start?
It is unfair that Asma left the Star, my Goooooooooooooood1
There is nothing nice about Maghreb star academy. It is very dull. I have watched it a few times and I didn't like it. And is this a studio where people would make the star academy. What a shame! When you wanted to make star academy, you should have been up to the task. In my opinion, I think that you shouldn't hold a second competition. There is no need to make the Middle Easterns scorn us.
I love two things in this life: you and roses. Roses for one day and you for every day, my beautiful Hajar Adnane, Diaa Ataybi, Asmaa Bssite, and Adnane Al Kari. I love you. I love you. I adore you. I love you so much, so much and so much. Long live the great Maghreb. Houda and Souka.
Libya free, free and Kadhafi out!
1, 2, 3 viva Algeria in spite of Egyptians! Algeria 1, Egypt 00000.
I am a Moroccan woman and before this an Arab. I am proud of my origins. I am against killing Moamer Kadhafi. This is what the west wanted. We are giving them the opportunity to occupy our ideas before our minds!
Miss Hajar Abdel Hami! I wish you success in Star'Ac.
Hi! I want to know the players of the national team. I'm crazy about them!
Salam. I'm Marwane from the city of Salé. When I listen to Nass El Ghiwane, I cry, by God, namely their album 'Mahmoma' even I don't have any concerns, thanks to God. But I love madly Nass EL Ghiwane I have some poems for them which will suit them. Special thanks to the late Larbi Batma, special thanks to the present Nas Al Giwane group namely Omar Sayad. Thanks to all Moroccans, long live Mohamed 6.
I am that young girl who dreams to become an actor. When you came to the town of Azrou. I wanted to talk to you but you were with some people. Do you remember me?
I'm a fan of Nass El Ghiwane. I wish for more songs like 'Nhla'. Thank you Nass El Ghiwan I wish they will come to visit us in Tinghir.
History
Hi I'm Taha from Morocco. I'm 25, I work n a company. What I like honestly about this site, is it possible to talk with ttal freedom or will I be accountable for what I will say, then it's better to keep quiet.
I haven't understood very well. But anyway, may God assist!
By God, if the mentality of the robbers doesn't change, we won't make any progress.
I am looking for a topic about sculpture.
The Moroccan army endures a severe famine in the Moroccan Sahara. This is a shame servants of God. The army is starving and they send aid to Burkina Faso.
Salam Muslims. What kind of marriage is this? Hijab is an obligation for every woman. Not anyone who wears it intending to marry. Are there any men left in this era so that women can waste their intention and religion? Anyway, everyone has his own way of thinking.
There are only lies in PC.
Nice designs.
To PFFFFFFFF, emulate and don't be envious! It is better to emulate rather than being idle and envious.
We hope to do some beneficial activity.
Salam alikum. I want information about houses and facilities in buying houses.
All caftans are great and distinguished by an artistic touch, smartness and fine style.

I like the Caftan. I hope someone will offer it to me one day.
I am Nour Houda from Essaouira. Sanaa Akroud is a dear artist to all the people. Is it true she died? Thank you very much.
I am a girl, 21. I am addicted to cannabis. I would like to restore a normal life.
Thank you for tackling this information.
Salam alikum. May God bless your efforts! Drugs have ruined our sons and dispersed families. We ask God to protect our sons and sons of all Muslims from this scourge. Then we ask officials to fight this scourge. We are in Ain Sbaa, our sons have become addicted to this scourge. By God, it is a real catastrophe in Ain Sbaa. We hope to get help.
I want to comment on these elections with sincerity. Moroccans like change. Therefore, don't be surprised for the victory of a new party. Yes, we like change. Thanks to everyone who voted for change.
What else can God send you? What they already have is enough for them. Suffice it for them that they are Christians and Jews. Our slain people are in paradise and your slain people are in hell, o tyrants o evils! Mohamed is very far away from you. If you can do anything to him, do it idle animals! This is the solution of the powerless who can't do anything. You are idle. We will sacrifice our lives for you, we will sacrifice our fathers and mothers for you, o beloved messenger of God!
Hi, how are you Bassma? You are the star of the academy 2009. Your voice is nice and nicer.
Morocco will take the cup inchallah
Salam. I am Ibtissam from Morocco. You deserve the title and no one else. By God many people envy you and people you know. Thank you.
Salam. I study in the second year of the baccalaureate and want to register at ITA; what are necessary documents?
I'm worried. I study at a vocational centre of OFPPT and would like to know if work can be secured after graduation. I want more encouragement from you to your young people.
Vocational training is a place for knowledge; it develops ideas and handicrafts.
I am Amal from Morocco. I have studied up to the baccalaureate literature. I don't know what I can do with it. I don't know what I can do even if I have excellent subjects including history and geography, sport and Islamic studies. If possible, please advise me. Thank you!
Salam, I am Halima from El Jadida. I would like to enrol in the vocational centre. But I face a problem. I don't know how to choose an appropriate subject. I like design and refrigeration. Is it possible to offer me information about subjects and main topics, so that I can choose without confusion? Thank you!
This is Siham from El Jadida. I study in the first year of the baccalaureate. I want to register with the ITA. What are the necessary measures to take in order to register?
Thank you for this site.
Hand in hand we will co-operate.
I'm a student in the second year of the baccalaureate. I want to register at a vocational training centre in Casablanca. Can I send the application via regular mail?
My name is Ihsane. I'm 19. I haven't completed my studies and I want vocational training.
Hi everyone. I love Badro, Farid, Yousra and Farah in particular. A big kiss to everyone. I wish you success, God willing. I hope to see a 2nd star academy this year. I hope that they will take our requests into consideration.
Take my heart and take care of it. I don't care about it; I am concerned about the great Maghreb where it is.
Thanks to God, the PJD didn't take the majority of seats in the parliament otherwise we would have experienced the same situation as in Palestine with Hamas and even if they took the majority, they would have lost their credibility with the people because they would not have been able to carry out their promises because the ruler is the king Mohamed VI may God assist him. And he wouldn't let the PJD implement its program which doesn't suit the era and the new developments; it would also take the country back to the prehistoric era. Zairo.
I LOVE YOU hajar, Abdhamid and Khayeri so much and Diea as well. God luck to all of you.
Greetings to you. Farid i love you so much. You can't imagine how angry I was when I heard that you were married and has a daughter called Dounia. But God is master of His affairs. What can I tell you? May God preserve her for you and preserve Zahia for you. I tell her you are lucky because you have a man like Farid. I want to tell you that you and I were born on the same day. Yes I am 20 and my dream was that you marry Yousra Zakri. But as I said, God is master of his Affairs. Honestly, I read in the newspaper of Panorama that in the last episode of Saraha, Farid the starac will make a surprise for you. This surprise is your engagement to Yousra!!! But I wasn't aware of all that.
Salam. How are you Amazigh people? What is your news, hope it is good. Welcome to this site. May God grant you peace.
I love Badou Zaki to death. Zaki forever. If Zaki is absent I advise you to stop watching them. We want Zaki because he has the Moroccan nationality. Zaki forever, it is Zaki who is there.
Hi, I am 2 fs, I want to reply to many friends who say that in rai there is just Khaled and Mami. Don't forget Cheb Hasni because he is the phenomenon of the season in all the sites of the world. Long live Cheb Hasni.
Salam. I am looking for someone to help me in order to set up my project in tourism, please!
Salam. Honestly, this is a nice project. It deserves that one thinks about it.
I am a Moroccan girl. I want the world to know that Moroccan girls are the most honourable girls in the world.
Hi. I want a girl. She must be veiled and smart.
Osama is the man and Arab leaders are despots.
I'm from Essaouira but live in the city of Laâyoune, I'm one of the big fans of the Gnaoua music, but only if Gnaoua music keeps its origins sanbil
When we say Essaouira we say Jadba and Gnaoua. I loved Gnaoua even before they became famous like this. I always listened to them in Essaouira.
Gnawa music, great, I like its style so much.
I love so much the city of Essaouira because it's my homeland I visit it every year and next time in the month 6/2008 inchallah. Thank you to all Morocco and the sons of Essaouira. A kiss.
Yes, like Amal has said, the best city, waw
There should be more action on women's issues.
KACM forever. RAJA are weak, FAR are copycats and Wydad are crybabies.
I am from Ouarzazate, the nice city. We welcome everyone who wants to visit us. Ouarzazate city has many nice landscapes.
This city has nice site. For example, it has Kasbahs. Ouarzazate has nice and great sites. It mainly has tourist sites, mountains.
I m so happy cz nader is the star ... nadoraaaaa I am from Lebanon we love you and adore you so much.
Congratulations to all Tunisians and all the Arab Maghreb for the victory of Nader who took the title. Honestly he deserves it, because I have never heard a voice like the voice of Nader in Western songs.
Thank you for this site!
Hi, listen to me. I would like to tell all the students, may God grant us success. Honestly, I am scared about the exam because only 15 days are left before the exam of 2009 and I have just begun studying. However, the lessons are difficult especially the nice philosophy. I had 7 in the regional exam. I study literature. I study in the high school Ibn Khatib in Tangier. Anyway, my brothers reply to me and give me some hope. Oh Lord grant us success. If I want to pass, I must get 10.50 in the national exam. Reply to me, may God protect you.
According to what I see, the level of education has dropped as a result of the carelessness of pupils about studying.
Hi my brother Rabie. I am Fahd Ghaimoura from Ouezzane. I wish you nice moments in this sacred month, with wishes of mercy, forgiveness and a world star, God willing. For me, you're better than Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise. Ouezzane residents are all proud of you and will be very happy if you attend the festival of Ouezzane.
Salam. I am Loubna. I like Rabie El Kati. He is a talented artist. His brother teaches us sports in Ait Melloul, Agadir.
Salam my dear friend Rabie. How are you doing? I miss you. I am Lhwari. I always think of you after the last series you did with Layla Trike. I am now in Agadir. I am happy because I have worked with you in this series. Good luck my friend.
Good evening brother Rabie. My name is Fahd Ghaimoura. I hail from Ouezzane. I send you many greetings from residents of Ouezzane. Ouezzaniane people are all proud of you and your roles. We hope you will honour us with your presence in the festival of Ouezzane.

Viva Al Qaeda! I support Osama bin Laden alive or dead!
Saida Fikri is the pride of all Moroccans thanks to the kind of music she presents. It is clean music accepted by our ears, conservative clean word, easy language understood by the young and adults. Finally, thank you, thank you Saida Fikri!
I am a student in the second year of the baccalaureate, humanities. I would like to have some orientation. Thank you!
May God make it a success; if there are no shadowy deals in this, it will be good for Morocco. Thank you.
As a student, I think that our education system is totally disconnected and below level because every teacher is just keeping an eye on the other. However, if everyone just assumed responsibility, things would be better for us. I will give you an example. The teacher gets into the class and keeps on talking. Then he would tell me, listen my son, come to take some extra tuition courses, bring 100 dirhams and don't worry you will secure your score of 17 in the result, hhhhhh! So just consider with me how can we get rid of such examples from schools think about what to do after the baccalaureate and which subject to study or listen you can just take extra tuition courses, ok!
I love Saida Fikri. She is a wonderful artist with a great repertoire. I wish to see her in a concert in Morocco. You're welcome and a thousand greetings to your country. Thank you Saida for your albums. They are all nice and worth listening to. God bless you! May God protect you for us! We don't forgive the one who expelled you from your country. He is worthless.
I am a student in the baccalaureate literature. I would like to study in the school of journalism. I have no information about it or the courses. I know nothing about it. If anyone is studying this subject, please reply. Thank you!
Saida, you're the best singer in the Arab World. Thank you very much! I am Brahim from Ketama. All Ketama population like you especially the song Jbal Rif (Rif mountains).
I am a student in the second year of the baccalaureate in the subject of CG accounting management. I ask you to help me in choosing the subject I will choose after passing the baccalaureate.
I swear by God there is no man artist or woman artist better than Saida Fikri. O Lord protect her for everyone who loves her!
We thank you for your great services!
I would like to participate.
The Moroccan team has lost the ball. They should better go and watch other teams. We no longer have football in Morocco. Look at Algeria, look at Egypt, look at Tunisia. They die for the national flag. But we have just defeats, traitors, pouring alcohol, and narguila. They don't care about the flag. Thank you.
I agree with the commenter who studies electric sciences and technologies.
I would like to tell you all may God grant you success. We just have to keep on achieving your goal. I too wish to achieve my goal. So pray with me!
I passed the bac with honours in electricity. Despite this, I was not accepted in any school. Everyone says keep the number till we call you. No school has invited me. In reality, one thinks that he did the correct subject at the beginning it is so. But after the bac, he regrets having chosen that subject.
Salam. I would like to know why you don't reply to our questions. Do you get our requests or not?
I am a student in TCS. I would like to get rid of studies. What should I do.
Salam. I am a student. I passed the baccalaureate in 2010 in humanities. I wanted to enroll in university to study psychology. However, conditions didn't help me. Therefore, I decided to join an institution of technology. I studied secretariat. But I wasn't successful because I was working at the same time. This is the reason for which I failed. But currently I want to work and study at university. Is it possible to for me to succeed in studies and work at the same time because I can't give up my work? I need work for a living. I love studies so much and want to develop myself. I am confused. I don't know what to do. Thank you! If you have any solution, please advise me! Thank you!
By God, this Hajar is very arrogant. Now, everyone who has a voice thinks that he is a star. May God heal you.
Hajar I love you so so much, may God grant you success. Long live Morocco.
Salam brothers. I have watched all of Star Academy Maghreb and the victory of Hajar was the result of her efforts and hard work, her voice was the best.
I am a student in scientific Tronc Commun. I would like to study sciences of life and earth.
Nothing will help with these people! These people should go to prison!
Liars and crooks!

I like all the participants namely and namely Khairi, Hajar and Kaoutar, kiss
In fact I liked this program but when Fatin went out it became without value because Fatin was the leader of the Dar and I love Hajar so much
I want to take part in this exhibition I'm a specialist in these things I'm a graduate of a school of design
I agree with all young people who say the baccalaureate this year is tough and the curriculum is long to the point that we haven't finished early. Just imagine that on the 25th of the month, we were still taking class exams! Is this not a delay? The ministry must find a solution so that we can overcome this problem, for God's sake!
Tunisia 164000 km² the smallest country in the Arab Maghreb. Its achievement reflects development you have reached. Congratulations. Long live Tunisia.
I would like to know if the passing rates are good this year.
When will results be announced?
Good evening. How are you? Honestly, the exam was slightly difficult. But good results will be a little difficult for some friends, in all honesty. I wish success to the entire Islamic nation, OK?
I wish success to all students of the baccalaureate, in all branches, especially the humanities.
Why do correctors reduce our grades when they correct our exams? Servants of God, one studies hard and in the end, they deprive him of grades! This is not acceptable! You will be accountable before God! Last year, I did well in history and geography but I had 6. May God take revenge on them, He will bring me my right!
Salam alikum. First of all, I beg you, I want the phone number of an association to help me as soon as possible!
I am not Moroccan - I want oriental music.
May God reward you with good! I would like to know when results of the second session will be announced! Thank you very much for these efforts!

May God make things easy for everyone! No one should intervene in the country of the other.
OUSSAMA BEN LADEN WAS KILLED BY JEWS BUT GOD SEND BILLIONS LIKE OUSSAMA TO DEFEND OUR ISLAM AND PROPHET MOHAMED (PEACE AND BLESSINGS OF GOD BE UPON HIM) I SAY: GOD'S CURSE ON THE WRONGDOERS AND THOSE WHO BEFRIENDED THEM. MASKS HAVE FALLEN AND THE TRUTH HAS EMERGED BACHAR+HASSEN NASRELLAT+BUSH ARE WORSHIPPERS OF TAGHOUT "ISRAEL" GOD'S CURSE ON ALL OF THEM!
If the freedom of expression offends the rulers, it's no longer freedom of expression, it's freedom of offending, and if it reaches the king the leader of the country, it's then silliness, they deserve punishment those silly men, those selfish men, they should go to prison.
There is no one like you in the world Cheb Mami. You deserve to be the king not just the prince.
I don't like rap, but Fnaire have nice words and lyrics. I want to tell them to continue talking about Moroccan youth.
Always Fnaire and "yed Lehna" always honour the sons of our country, always raising our heads. Thank you very much.
I have some very old songs of Mami. I love Mami so much.
I love Fnaïre so much, I want their msn, I am mad about them. God bless them.
Cheb Mami shouldn't sing with Nancy Aajram, very young!
I want to register in the vocational training. I have no father and mother. I am an orphan: fatherless and motherless.
I wish success to the national team in the upcoming match.

We like this reward and thank his majesty the King Mohamed VI.
elghoul the algerian harmonica prodigy master of the word and the note... check and more... El Anka they say ask Cheikh el anka and you'll make sure, el anka tell us the name of your successor, the cheikh answered in person, presently no living soul has seen my successor, Sultane of the word and speech,... There can be only one ghoul.
Bless your Ramadan. Come to visit us in Sidi Lakhdar. My greetings to all the sons of Sidi Lakhdar. I say to the son of Hagano congratulations for 4x4. God will compensate you Hadj Ahmed, good luck.
Long live Abd Lhamid and Tangier- we are proud of you and, God willing, you will show them true Tangier people, ok? And God willing Nessma from success to success.
Oh these taxi drivers are gaining importance they're asking for a raise even if the price of oil has gone down they don't want to reduce their rates and moreover they want to keep on living in chaos without any law or anything else, I never saw a country where taxi drivers drive chaotically and some are drunk and they accept it. These Moroccan people are a catastrophe, they will destroy this country.
Why don't you Berbers come to Nador?
Yes sister Bouchra. I like you with your comment. I love you, I love you. This is Midou.
I want to register for vocational training.
I am 17 and I die for Fnaire.
I'm with everyone. The dialogue and opinions are very nice. I agree with them all, especially the illiterate woman. Everyone must study, fight illiteracy and ignorance.
It is impossible to remain silent.
By God the national team needs a spirit. It has an arsenal of players but they need a catalyst. We wish them success especially Benatiya.
A very good article. God willing, these projects will be realized. Morocco forever, keep it up!
May God grant you dignity Mr Ben! By God, Sahrawis need many people like you to show these mice history and that our ideal future is Morocco, Morocco, Morocco! If they don't listen, it is their problem! We don't want Algeria oh creatures of God! Help!
Oh this is good and it helped me, keep up the good work!
Very nice.
Yes open my brother, I miss my brothers, I have never seen them.
O Lord support the supporters of sharia by all Your names and with Your powers defeat the clans of Satan!
God and our fate!!!
I liked so much this site and learnt from it. Thank you.
Hi. I am the plasterer of Fez. Peace of God be upon you.
Salam. I hope you will help me. My brother is 15, he is addicted to sniffing glue and cigarettes. I want an association in Agadir.
Salam alikum. I am asking for your help. I have a brother, he is 25. He is really addicted given some family problems in which we were living. We took him to a psychologist but without result. Now he was even more affected by the death of our father. He tries to drink alcohol in order to forget. I hope you will reply and advise me what to do. Thank you!
Salam alikum. There is no need to bother yourself with Moukawalati. You will just waste your time. They will suffocate you with false promises. They are useless. They say they encourage young people. Quite the opposite, they break the ambitions of young people and leave them helpless.
First of all, I address my greetings to all my friends in this site. I also hope from God that everyone will receive what he deserves. My friends, I would like to present you a project of traditional handicraft in order to absorb labour force in Morocco, reduce unemployment, save young people who waste their time in cafés where every day you see a dealer or drug seller who attract young women and young men to take drugs especially narguila. This phenomenon has ruined traditions and customs of this great country. Therefore, I would like to address all those in charge of development project in the country and youth programmes which help young people morally or materially. I am a Moroccan young man working in the manufacture of traditional tiles which was ruined and lost its taste because of the spread of ceramics. If anyone wants to communicate, you're welcome.
Lies in lies!
Young people are mere thieves and lie to us.
Salam alikum. The first thing I wish in Morocco is its extinction because the government is pulling on one side and the people as well. I see that young people today are mainly following addiction, this is loss. This doesn't let them summon the courage to work hard. They are very lazy at the expense of their interest. Drugs make them forget their lives. Alcohol destroys the drunken. They must work. It is God Who will help you. As for the people, they won't give you anything. You should work for this life and the afterlife. There is death no matter what you have. Azul my Amazigh people! May God rest the soul of Abdelkrim EL Khattabi who sacrificed his soul, the top man!
Salam alikum. I am a young man from Morocco. I work in Spain in the sector of building. I think of returning to Morocco. I ask you to advise me with some advice in order to set up a project. I think of setting up a building firm. I need your help with ideas. Salam alikum.
My name is Hamid from the town of Tinghir. I would like to set up a business. I would like to invest in trade in the town of Tinghir. I want you to help me with some information about the nature of projects which are consistent with the nature of the place and which can secure for me some profits. Salam alikum. Looking forward to your reply. Thank you!
I am a young man from Morocco. I have a diploma in agriculture. I would like to set up a business. I would like to be informed about that loan so that I can apply for it. I want to work. I am 21.
Salam. I hail from Meknès. I would like to set up a business in plaster works. I am experienced in this field, praise be to God. I would like to have some advice. Thank you.
Badou Zaki forever, I hope that he becomes a coach to the Moroccan national team with the will of God. Long live Morocco and Atlas Lions forever.
I want Badou, and for the players I want Aloudi, Haji, Chemakh, Abou Cherwan, Safri, Lmokhtari and remove Badr Alkadouri and Houssin Kharja. Long live Morocco and long live Zaki.
I personally like Zaki. I hope that he starts his career anew with the Moroccan national team so that we forget what happened in Ghana and to look ahead. Oh Lord we hope that Zaki be one of the winners.
I love Badou Zaki. He i9s the best coach for Morocco and he has Moroccan citizenship ok.
Nasro the son of my country.
Bado Zaki is a distinct coach for the Moroccan national team.
Toraya Jabran must invoke the Moroccan reality which she was representing on stage so that it can be saved. The resources of one festival can cover the requirements of 1,000 young men. No to wasting money.
Yes, make more festivals and forget the lost youth. Why are these monies not invested in projects?
Salam alikum brothers. This topic dealt with rights of women and violence against her even if in Morocco there are men who are victims of violence. They should be considered. We should know the cause of this violence against women and why it was practiced against her before judging man. We should also add to the right of woman the right of man. There should be jobs offers for men before women. It is illogical that women work in administrative functions but her husband works only at home. We don't say deny her the right to work but offer work opportunity to her husband first before her unfortunately!!! Our country cannot even offer jobs to men and you think of women.
1, 2, 3 viva Algeria!
I liked this site a lot, there's nice news.
You have your religion and we have our religion. Our dear prophet, peace and blessings of God be upon him, is mentioned in all divine Books. He was sent to us to gather all divine Books in one Book which is the Holy Qur'an. So support the messenger of God, peace and blessings of God be upon him, and God will support you!
Salam. I am a married woman. I have a 5 months old baby. My husband assaults me. He doesn't give me my rights. I want to divorce but I don't know where to go or money to subsist and support my sons. He has his house where he live in the Netherlands. I want to ask whether I and my son have the right to remain in the house if I divorce or what is the ruling or the family law? Thank you.
I want to ask you about the subject of philosophy. Which lesson will they presented? Please reply.
The exam was a little long. However, praise be to God for everything.
I wish to reach the baccalaureate in the quickest way.
I am Amazigh, but Mohammed is my messenger.
I need help. Honestly, when I go to micro-loan institutions, I don't find a solution to problems. I ask you please to help me in order to solve my financial problems. There are some who benefitted from this but there are many who haven't benefitted yet. Therefore, I ask you to help. Thank you!
Nothing.
I respect my country. I respect its policies but I want a debate about women police officers. I love so much police service but they refused me because I am 1.65 m in height. This has caused me real disturbance and stigmatized me. I want a convincing reply.
Exalted be God! Denigrating the greatest person of the Islamic Umma! I am at your service o messenger of God!
What can I tell you? The solution is easy but each government is evading it. It is mending the way as this is the first and foremost cause. Secondly, there is liquor and drugs. Remove liquor.
Long live Algeria. God willing we will win 3-0.
I am a Muslim woman. Acts are measured on the basis of intentions. We should feel pride in Islam. I am a young girl. When I am with my family in the street, I feel ashamed in these girls shoes, by God! They are causing sedition. Anyway, may God guide them! We should not forget that the Hour is coming.
You don't guide anyone, it is God Who guides anyone He wants.
We are slaves in this looted country.
Morocco should fear God in the nation. The government of Abbas El Fassi is failing. The government will be changed by militancy.
We are Algerians and it is between us!
Salam. We want jobs for all classes of Moroccan society who have diplomas and who couldn't find jobs. Thank you!
Thank you very much! Thanks!
Greetings MCA
May God rest the soul of Moamer Kadhafi, martyr of the nation. You Libyans wait for the consequence of what you did. You weren't Muslims.
I am a big fan of Amar. As my friend has said "May the Lord have mercy on the soul of Sheikh el fayzin [rest in Amazigh]".
Hi Casa I am Hamza I live presently in Libya. I support Maroc Telecom so much but there is just one thing. We need more free services.
Salam. I would like to reply to those who call for freedom. Do you accept your mother, sister or wife to be naked in front of the people? No, by God, you won't accept this. But you like to look at other girls. This is why you encourage them. I don't think that there is a man in a house from where an unveiled woman comes out. The man who defends women who don't wear the veil is under the shoes of Christians. Return to your senses! By God, I see that you are behind the Islamic civilisation. Salam.
But how can these armed fighters be convinced by scholars that fighting in Islamic countries is banned while scholars say that it is permissible to fight in Syria and don't even denounce the killing of Imam Alboti who was always againt such teachings????
I wish them continuity and success namely to Abdelhamid, Hajar and Ahmed
...I love the stars of star academy namely Abdelhamid, Ahmed and Badrou
I love Badro, Badro thanks for coming back, we didn't want you to leave, we also love Khairi so much, Khairi why did you go, I love Hajar, Abdelhamid, Badro, Hajar, I love you all, I love you Maghreb Star Academy
I wish you success and happiness in your life my sister Sara. God bless you for this success! Pray for me to pass because this year I will sit for the baccalaureate exam. Pray for me to pass God willing! I hope when you start to perform your prayer, you will pray with me and with students who sit for the baccalaureate this year. Thank you!
Very nice, well done! I congratulate you for that score. I hope that I too will have such a good score.
Greetings to all Amazigh people in the world and I prefer this channel and wish it good start.
We can't call every brilliant student a hero. There are some students who could have made a good performance but they don't have resources. Honestly, she is hard-working students but even conditions were favourable. We wish her, us and everyone success.
Salam alikum. I am pleased to write you these few words which express my feelings of relief especially when you see a young girl in the baccalaureate level surpassing everyone with a very high score 18.68. This is nice. We wish to this sister a prosperous future. Wish success, God willing to all students in all levels!
I thank everyone who contributed to reviving the Amazigh language. As an Amazigh man, I like to defend it but without fighting the Arabic language. It is the language of Islam. I think as well that there should a reconsideration of the Amazigh language in terms of teachers because most of them aren't fluent in it. There should be a standardization of Tifinagh alphabet and publish new simplified books to teach Amazigh language and avoid a deep study of its grammar or standardize it because some of them teach grammar rules different from those taught by others.
Hi. Everything is nice.
Thank you my brothers. I am an Amazigh and proud of my origins. This is not all, I am also proud of the Amazigh civilization. In the class where I study, I faced the opposition of one of the philosophy teachers because I am Amazigh. He doesn't even recognize the existence of the Amazigh language. By the way we are 5 in the class which don't speak Amazigh language. So what is the solution?
Peace, mercy and blessings of God be upon you.
Salam alaikum. Happy Ramadan. I want to talk to you about a topic, ok.
Mohamed Chokri used a very audacious style which is not used by other authors. This broke boundaries.
I am a woman who always feels that I can do much in this field of social assistance. Therefore, I address you my request to join any association interested in helping needy people on Agadir. I have a baccalaureate degree 2006 and one year study at university of law Ibn Zohr.
Hi all Moroccans.
There is no power and no will but from God. What is this? Is there no reason or respect? Where is Morocco, my country, and where it is building its life, while there are some who are not living? What can I say? The mouth is incapable of speaking.
This event cannot be confirmed as there are no reliable sources. Islam does not authorise stoning only after confirming the act with the testimony of witnesses. This story is forged. It aims to distort the reputation of Islamic courts as it happened in Afghanistan when they distorted the image of Taliban movement depicting them as oppressive and tyrannical. But in reality, Jews, Christians and their followers including hypocrites, are plotting against Islam in different means. Oh Lord, we ask your mercy, oh Lord support your religion and your faithful subjects, amen my Lord.
To Mr Benouda, wake up! It seems to me that you are one of those who want things to be easy and neat. Go to work! The old people have all left it. They have all worked hard. You think that the hero becomes a hero easily. What are you expecting more than ENSEJ, ENGEM and others? You're one of those who want its ruin! God willing, in your head. Viva Algeria!
Haram!
Salam. O tyrants like Kadhafi! You pray for his mercy after he killed the sons of his country, young people, women and children. You are like Kadhafi! I say to the great Libyan people, congratulations for this victory! O Libyans, strong people, viva Libyan heroes and death to tyrants who are with Kadhafi. May God not rest him in peace! I support Libyans.
I love Kadhafi. Shame on you!
I have to prepare a file about the contribution of Moroccans in World War II but I haven't found anything. Please if you know something important help me.
Look my brothers, I have also made a film about the contribution of Morocco. You should follow your methodology and you can find more than what you are looking for. Thank you everyone.
Thank you! We learnt so much! How are you? This site is very interesting!
Salam. I want a topic about the military contribution of Morocco in the second world war.
Why don't they let us study this year? What do they expect from us we students of the nation? Why don't they want to teach us? Say what do they want? Houda.
Hi Rachid! I am Jamila from Casablanca. I love you very much and I think you are a big actor. For me my only dream is to see you! You have become very dear to me because you are humble. Good luck. Jiji
Hello! I love Hassan Foulan very much because he is truly a big actor! greetings to his son Mehdi and daughter Sihame.
I love those who love me
Salam. This site is nice. I have a comment about the subject of physics. It was difficult and so was mathematics. I ask God to grant me, all my friends and all Moroccans success. Thank you again.
Hello Rachid! How are you? Any new roles yet? I love your films seriously! I am Driss from Germany. If you ever come here, you are more than welcome to visit me my brother you are very much loved here by my family.
Thank you very much.
Salam.
I wish the welfare of all Moroccans and all Arab countries.
I'm Jalal from Spain; I don't agree with Abbas El Fassi, we want Driss Jettou who was better working in favour of the Moroccan communities abroad. I hope that Abbas will make an effort for Morocco to progress. Long live Morocco. Long live Mohamed VI, may God grant him long life. Long live the Moroccan government.
Viva the king! Viva my country! Viva Mohamed VI!
Praise be to God, peace and blessings be upon the prophet of God. I am against beating and I am also against nakedness.
Diaa you must work more and with the will of God you will make it to the final, oh Lord. With the will of God Mirhan, Mirhan will go out, she is just a dancer not a singer and she has no voice either.
Hi, not bad but absent OK.
I would like to join this team. I want the website of this school. Thank you!
There are many problems in Tangier; they're pushing Parliament on us, saying it is reformed.
Kadhafi is a real man!
If this programme is implemented, I could be one of the first who will benefit from it. I am a divorced woman. I live with my ex-husband in the same house because I am not working and I have three daughters. Therefore, I preferred to stay with him so that he would provide for us. When I went to my parents', he wasn't providing for us. Anyway, they are exploiting me for the house and maintenance. There are many divorced women who do like me because it is the easiest solution.
Hajar deserves the title and she has honoured Morocco, she's a star star star and I wish her good luck and I'm crazy about her and I used to watch her regularly, and thanks.
Always!
Haifa I hate you. Believe me there are many girls prettier than you and I am the first of them. hhhh. You are in fashion now but soon you will be a has been. How I pity you!
Tunisia will win inchallah.
Haifa Wehbe is a very normal thing, what's with all the extra love?
Salam Batma. You're great in Arab Idol. I wish you success in your artistic career.
Mehdi, I die for my country and our king Mohamed VI. Morocco forever!
In the name of God the most gracious the most merciful. Islam is the word of peace. Prophets are servants of the king of kings, Lord of the worlds. If the sons of Adam and Eve implemented what our Lord said about His messenger, you wouldn't see injustice, bribery or greediness. I will conclude by saying may God guide His creatures!
When are we going to rise up if not on this occasion? Our beloved prophet is denigrated, what can we do? They are plotting and we are talking about the tolerance of Islam. By God, our souls won't rest in peace until we take revenge.
This is a nice site
Shame on you! This is too much!
The producer of this film is not a man and doesn't know that even if he repents, God won't accept his repentance. We are Muslims. This is a shame. For me, I wish to see the producers of this film burnt in the fire of hell, God willing because we Muslim don't offend any religion. We respect them. May God take revenge on them!
May God guide us and protect us!
I witness there is no other God but Allah and I witness that Mohamed is the messenger of God. God is the greatest! God is the greatest! God is the greatest!
Mohamed is our messenger whether you like it or not.
Congratulations to the Libyan people, many congratulations!
I'am Sara and maryam I love you so much Abdelhamid and inchallah you'll win and all Morocco loves you so much I love you and Hajar I love you Abdelhamid so much I love you madly and also my family I'm from Morocco Ouazzane

I want to join customs service.
Thanks to brother Ramy and all the Palestinian brothers who praised Algeria and the university of Jijel. I know brother Ramy and almost all the foreign brothers personally. I tell them again you are nice people and real men. You deserve all the best. Welcome here. Many congratulations Ramy Abou Ezzouz for your graduation.
how are you, the carpet is nice
God willing we will play the African Cup.
I love Antar Yahia so much. Why have you deceived yourself with that monkey? You're handsome, normally you should have taken a beautiful woman. How did you end up with a monkey? She doesn't even look to be the sister of Ziani. Ziani is a thousand times better looking than she is!
Thank you Ziani. Congratulations for the victory against Zambia.
This is very good, thank you.
VivaTOUFIK MAKHLOUFI!!!! Viva Algeria!!!
I want to see the fashion show.
Raja forever!
I hail from Tiflet. We don't have authorities. We are lost in this town. By God, Tiflet is very humiliated. I don't know what is wrong with it. This is a shame. People are oppressed and silent. There are no companies and nothing. We just needed a prison and they built it in our town! Where is our government, we need war in our country!
A greeting to the pariliament of 2001 Justice!
Hi, I am Jala from Rabat and Badou Zaki.
Salam. God willing Morocco, Tunisia and Algeria will qualify to the World Cup.
I am from Agadir, I have a baccalaureate degree. I'm working now, but I found that a diploma is necessary to improve oneself. Therefore, I'll return to get one.
I am a Moroccan citizen. In the World Cup qualifiers I was supporting Algeria because it is the sister of our country. I wish victory to Morocco. Thank you!
We are against the foreign coach. We want Zaki to come back and make us happy as he did before.
Salam. I'm a young man, 19. I want to take part in the professional training because I like it. I want your help, please. My question is: What are the conditions to enroll? Please reply, thank you!
Morocco forever! Algeria forever!

If possible, I want to know how to enrol at the professional training centres. I want to study carpentry. Thank you!
Salam. We want Bado Zaki.
The best channel in the world. But we are waiting for star academy with confidence. Nessma will this time surpass all satellite channels.
Hi Nessma TV, hi everyone, my friend and Relizane my darling. Malik.
I love Star Academy Lebanon and I love to participate with you but I wasn't lucky.
Royal Armed Forces forever.
Farid, you're the best one in the star academy. Bent Ain Azel Setif.
Cheb Hasni is the king of rai without rival. If he were still alive, may God rest his soul, he would have been the best singer in the world because he has the greatest voice. He is better than Khaled and other rai singers.
Hasni, may God rest his soul, nothing else.
Always the capital and FAR.
We were proud to see the son of our town an engineer but you have disappointed us Fouad. So I hope that you regret what you did. Despite this we don't hate you but we are sorry for you to claim your release and that you take a lesson from what happened. I hope that they will release you. Asma, long live Goulmima.
Zanniti 22/04/2008 Salam; I wish that there was no difference between prince Rachid and the reporter Rachid because we are all Moroccans, we have one nation and one religion so why there is no difference between the two names Rachid and Rachid. We also want to hold the flag of Morocco high. This goal can be achieved only by equality between the members of the nation.
OK take me to prison I am Mohamed 6.
I no longer understand anything about this.
Pop music makes the heart shiver! May the Lord have mercy on the great singers and give long lives to the living!
Salam
A greeting of peace and Islam to my dear brothers. In my opinion, it should be screened but as Muslims we want his end to be Islam and comprehensive religion most probably so that we call others to join our religion. Thank you. Bye.
Chamakh is the best Arab player
Hi Chmakh, I'm Hajar, I love you so much, you're my hero, you're too excellent, I always hope to be your wife according to the precepts of God and sunna, but I think it's possible, it's a dream, but I congratulate you, take care, my msn only for Chamakh
Hi Chamakh, how are you? I love you so much. This is my msn:
Hi how are you Chamakh I'm Safeya, you're the best player, wish you success and may God protect you.
Hi, my name is Yasser. I love Marouane Chamakh so much, because he plays well. With success inchallah...
Congratulations Nader!
Salam alikum. I would like to talk about Mehdi Carcela. Why did he prefer Morocco to Belgium although he sees that none of the Moroccan players who play in Belgium were called up last year? Of course he will choose Morocco.
I love judo sport. It is in my blood. All my friends ask me to participate in the championship. I always refuse although I have good skills. My best friends are Younes Borasi, Asfwan Aataf and Abou Lfarah Ahmad.
Judo forever. May God assist the jury.
Nader, congratulations to you and to us. I love you so much and wish you good luck in your personal life and artistic career. Nader you are the star whatever happens. I love you, Hedia.
I practice judo in Morocco. I am proud of practicing judo. I thank the Royal Federation. Imdae Faoula.
I am an Algerian man living in Morocco (Oujda). 14 years of closed borders, so we don't ask for the reopening of borders, we ask for the building of a wall along the border. (a separating wall, dust-proof from both sides). 14 is too much. Generations and generations have gone. They forgot us, there are no Algerians in Oujda, the free Algerians are those who bring Euros, but those who look for their homes aren't Algerian.
Long live Algeria and Morocco forever, thank you.
Rabie is considered up to now one of the most handsome Moroccan actors. He is a super star. If you say his height, the way he walks, his look in his eyes and nice image. He is the star in every film or serial without rival. He is still young and manly in all his roles. I hope he acts in an action film because from what I see he is a sportsman of the first level. I hope he listens to my words. This is the role in which he is distinguished in addition to love stories.
Hi. I am Hamadi Bousselham from Souk Larbaa. I like the way you act. I want to see him directly. I wish to have his phone number. Pride to actors in Morocco.
Hi Rabie Kati. I am Kawtar from Casablanca. I love the people of Taza so much. I don't know why I have a liking for them. Anyway Rabie, may God assist you and grant you success.
Honestly, for me you are the best actor. I wish you success in your work.
I am not going to tell you I love you or anything. I will just say may God make things easier for you and protect you from evil people. Take care of your parents. May God grant you success. I know you well.
Salam. I am a young man from Morocco. I want you to help me, if you don't mind.
Salam Nancy, I love you to death, by God I really love this name.
May God take revenge for the oppressed, God awaits but doesn't forget.
Viva Algeria! Viva Bouteflika! Victory and eternity for our martyrs!
Ifrane is the ugliest village on earth.
Amnoun is like a wolf that catches locusts… He reached them all but doesn't know which one to catch. There just one thing I want to ask Amnoun about and I want him to reply to me sincerely. How come Lkhachmar are Chorafa (honourable) when he said that they are like Aladarissa? May be he would tell us tomorrow that his grandfather is Sharon.
Salam alikum. I am a Moroccan woman. I live in Spain and I am now engaged to an Iraqi man who lives in Iraq. He proposed to marry me and made a request to this end to my family. Now, we want to marry. However, Belgium is complicating things. We can't marry at the municipality or even at the Moroccan consulate. It is necessary that we both live under the same roof even if we aren't yet married. That's not our tradition or customs as taught by our families. I don't want to do anything wrong to myself or to the young man I will marry. We want everything to be done according to the tradition of the messenger, peace and blessings of God be upon him. Please, if you have any clue to answer my question, write to my email. Thank you! I wish everyone a happy life.
I am a law student. I want a clear explanation of some texts in the family law.
Let God act, that's all, happy Ramadan!
Jawad Gharib is the best runner in the world.
Good evening. I agree with you too. I found no one to guide me and I haven't yet passed the bac. However, if I pass, I don't know what to do afterwards.
Saida fikri is the best singer. There are people who don't know the value of Saida Fikri. Saida Fikri raises the awareness of young people and shares their sufferings. Saida Fikri, my dream is to meet you some day. I hope that my dreams becomes true.
I am a student in the second year of the baccalaureate in physical sciences. I will sit for the exams very soon. But I haven't found anyone to guide me afterwards.
Honestly, Saida Fikri is the queen of singing in Morocco. I wish her continuity.
I study in the baccalaureate SVT. I had 11.50 in the regional exam. I would like to know what prospects are after the baccalaureate.
I am a student in the baccalaureate. I study SVT but I don't know what to do afterwards and other available possibilities after university.
I am a student in the second year of the baccalaureate. When I pass the bac, I want to study in ISTA. I don't have an idea about it. I would like to know languages and special fields there.
Is it true that you married Cheb Layn?
Are there any prospects? I am a student in the first year of the baccalaureate and I want to study agricultural sciences.
I am a student in the technical branch. I like this subject so much.
This subject is very nice. However, I don't know the future prospects of mechanic branch. Thank you very much!
Salam. This year I study in the year of the baccalaureate in the subject of electricity. I had 11.75 in the regional exam. Do you think I can pass? I have one more question. Are scores considered for the first or second term?
The individual in this era, in this dear country can only say God suffices us, God suffices us, God suffices us and He is the best mandate!
I am a student in the first year of the baccalaureate. I would like to know the difference between PC and SVT subjects.
Wishing you a successful career, Hajar, God willing. I love you. I hope to meet you someday.
I am happy with the artistic career of Hajar Adnane. This shows her voice is great, nice and cultivated. In addition to trust in people and beauty, so appreciated by the fans.
I am a girl from Morocco and I am proud of all Moroccan girls, OK? I would like to tell sister Hajar she is always in our hearts, since she creates new works which touch the hearts of young people. May God assist you and grant you a nice life! I address my greetings to everyone on this forum because we are united by one thing: Hajar. I love you, Hajar! Bye!
Salam. I am Maryam from Morocco, from Tiznit, to be precise. Here everyone likes you because you've lifted the Moroccan flag. Well done! You have honoured us! I love you so much, Hajar!
The Amazigh language will survive with or against the will of the stupid Arab, from here I address a warning to the socialists chauvinists that we'll revenge for the killing of the Amazighs Alhasnawi and Alfasawi.
Great!
Nice.
I am Younsse from Rabat. There is rap and Mawazine.
I like Farah, Yosra, Abdlhamid and Kawtar, I'm Intisar from Tetouan, 13 years old
Where is the harm of drugs?
I agree with you the baccalaureate degree is worthless in our time because some people pass by cheating. Moreover, it is just a sheet of paper. It is useless.
Yes I agree with you!
Salam. I am Sana. Honestly, after reading what you wrote, I totally agree with you. In reality, the regional exam is a serious hurdle. Last year, I had a problem which made me lose concentration in the exam although I am a hard-working student. I usually have a score of 17 in French as well as in Islamic studies and 10 in mathematics. The most important thing is that I answer questions. But in the exam I was very confused. When I received the score I was shocked. Even my teachers couldn't believe it. I couldn't repeat the year so I continued. However, now I no longer trust my abilities. Is the problem in the system or us? Honestly, I no longer understand anything.
Yes, they are really unjust to us, by God. There are some who don't write anything and get 16 but the poor who fills the paper gets 9. Sincerely, they don't correct well, they are messing up.
Salam to all Moroccan students. The most important thing is that the educational level in Morocco is very low. In the curricula, there are too many colours and pictures without use. Why do we find many students failing in exams? It is because teachers today are only interested in girls and useless gossip. They make no efforts with students.
My name is Fatat. I am looking for a job. I am 21.
I just want to pass. This is the major concern of all students to pass in order to win respect in Morocco.
Hhhhh, you're teasing the servants of God, hhhh!
I don't know what to say. Anyway, I like it
I personally hope people will do their duty as they should since our king, may God assist him, didn't spare efforts for citizens and responded to their demands. So now the ball, as we say, is with the people; they must choose with fairness especially young people. They are the main beneficiary from the coming change in our country, God willing.
I am looking for a job.
Salam alikum. I am Radwan. I have a good education level. I need a job. I am a welder. I live in El Jadida. I am 30.
Salam. I am Nadia. I am looking for a job as a hairdresser. Thank you!
I know that Morocco is great.
Hi, how are you? I thank you for this festival. I hope that the Festival of Laughter will be in the cultural complex in Mohammedia.
Hi everyone, we hope that you'll bring something new. Okkkkkkkkkk
I am a student in mathematical sciences. I would like to know the best specializations if possible after the baccalaureate.
...you have to change Nabila, she talks badly and excessively, all those candidates are mad in a way you can't imagine, I'm so amazed with you people, curse you and Maghreb Star Academy.
I'm happy with this experience which will take the Maghreb forward, I ask allah that it'd be up to our expectatons.
Salam Fnair, I want to sing with you plz.
Healthy breakfast to all Moroccans!
I am a car driver. I am looking for a job as I need it.
I am Bilal from Morocco, Tetouan. Age: 28. I want a job as driver with any one.
I want an easy job may God reward you with good!
Good evening everyone. I want some information about professional training in the field of management informatics and hotel management.
Salam. I am Zair. I am looking for a job as driver. We ask this Moukawala to communicate with us. Thank you!
I want a job.
What is the importance of work?
In my opinion, it is important to adopt laws to protect women victims of violence especially in Islamic countries. This is because Islam has already protected them. It granted them all their rights as it has made them equal in all fields. In the holy Qur'an, we find that as it has mentioned man, it mentioned woman. Moreover, we shouldn't forget that woman is the mother who bore us for nine months, breast-fed us for two years, stayed up late for nights. Woman is also the sister, aunt, wife and daughter. As it is said in Hadith "When have you enslaved people while their mother gave birth to them free". Oh Muslims, follow the attitude of the messenger with his wives, God bless them. Thank you for reading my opinion. I hope that you will consider laws and the instructions of Islam.
It is women who are stirring trouble against themselves, by God, because they don't want to mind their own business.
Where are phone numbers and addresses of these listening centres for women victims of violence?
This is good.
Long live Cabatna always number one, inchallah, they will always be on the top.
The country of Miki, country of Tiki, the country where everything is fraudulent, everything is fabricated.

Thank you. Can this disease be transmitted through kisses?
I want you to come to visit us in Chaouen, you are all welcome here in Chaouen.
Hi Fnaire. You're always smart. I would die for you. I wish you the best in your artistic life. I love you so so so much. My greetings to Mouhessine. Kisses!
Salam. You are the best band in hip-hop.
O Libyans, you are stupid when you killed Kadhafi because you weren't able to do this alone.
Hi. My name is Magid. I live in Khmisset. I am from the national association of education and culture chaired by Adberahman Sokri. I want to join you. I hope you will accept me and that you will approve me, Amnesty International, phone no.
Salam. I am Samar from Morocco. Haifa Wehbe, I like her songs. I like her beauty. I wish her always success. However, what I don't like is the idleness of Haifa. Be yourself, be serious, be determined not to be removed from the throne of fame. Be more serious like me, like me, (unclear) like me, courage with wisdom. I like Oum Kaltoum in her simplicity. Think of Oum Kaltoum and you will see what I mean.
Your body is nice but your eyes aren't natural, like me, ha!
I really love Ahmed for the sake of the beautiful Hajra, may God help you and gather them in matrimony, Amen.
Hind Sabri is like a small partridge.
There is nothing.
LOL it seems to me you are sick. If you like an artist, just write a message like anyone else not write your number. This is not a way to talk to a star. Bye, see you soon.
I'm Moroccan, I offer my support to our Algerian brothers, salam alaikoum.

My name is Hicham. I am 23. I would like to set up a project for growing cows. I have a stable and land. I need the capital. How can I get it from Moukawalati?
I would like to set up a business and I need a loan of 20 billion centimes.
Salam. I am a young man born in 1984. I live in Morocco. I would like to start up a business in the building sector. I would like to know what I should do.
Salam. I would like to know how to take a loan and if interests are like the bank? What are necessary papers?
"Memory of a body" is the nicest nicest thing I read this author is great really great
I am a layman citizen. Has anyone benefited from Moukawalati? It is a project which was started up with your capitals! You have been asking questions since 2008 on this page, now we are in 2012, has anyone benefited or not? Stop humiliating yourselves and begging like dogs! Live like men and God will bring you your projects. Just work, God is great!
Anyone who does something for the sake of his country and young people needs someone to help him.
Salam alikum my dear brothers. I have a diploma in painting and would like to set up a business. I need financial support but I don't know what to do. Please help me, may God reward you with all the good!
Salam. My name is Ahmed. I live in Salé. Why was Matate removed by the guys from Tabriket?
We hope that Zaki returns to the national team
I want Morocco to bring Hassan Alla.
I wanted Roger Lemerre to coach the Moroccan national team. I was very happy with Lemerre although I had doubts about the coaching of Fathi Jamal. I also thank you and the players of the national team such as Alloudi, Chamakh and Hajji. I want Rolando, Kritin, Ronaldo, Rolandinho to play with the national team.
I want Mr Zaki, I want Zaki so much. Mohnda from Turkey.
I am Noor from Turkey. I want Lemerre to come back to train the national team. Bye. There is nothing.
Truly yes.
I love Chamakh, Hajji and Fathi Jamal.

Salam alaikoum plz plz I love you Nasro and want his msn plz may God protect you.
Salam alikum. I want from you my brother readers to give me a topic about religious education in the pre-schooling period. Thank you.
This initiative is good.
I'm proud of all Moroccans all of them, ok, especially the beautiful Hajar.
Of course because we Moroccans are always beautiful and inchallah Asmae Basite will be a star, yes.
Salam, how are you. What star academy is in the world, you seem to forget yourselves, you are supposed to be Muslims. Is singing allowed, have you ever seen any Moroccan doing his ablutions and going to pray or an Algerian, may God guide you. Stand up and follow the Lebanon star academy, it has started as well. Najat from Taza, 16 years old.
Good morning, I'm Naima from Oujda, I greet Hajar warmly.
Congratulations!
I think dubbing in Darija will contribute to the spread of the Moroccan language although slightly. I think this is a good initiative but we have to think of dubbing serials which transmit a constructive message to society.
I hope that God will grant me success in the exams and grant success to those who will take the exam.
We did well, my friends and I, in the exam in Paloma Blanka, Tetouan. But three failed. Thank you everyone.
I want to know the names of the successful students in the province of Nador.
Hi, how are you? The exam was a bit difficult.
When will the results of the second session of the 2008 bac be announced? Please reply to me immediately.
May God assist us, God willing. This is sad for Algeria.
Long live Algeria.
In the name of God the Beneficent the Merciful. Peace of God be upon our master Mohamed, his family and Companions. I will say as our ancestor said (unclear) over its mother, its rulers and women are the cause of its destruction, it won't be settled unless its owner is found.
Kadhafi is over!
Hahaha shame on you, you want Moamer! Just tell me one good thing which Moamer did! Just one thing, then when the killer dies, we will see you in the same hole where he is, poor people! you will see your best personal(giddafi) in the hell with you,,,hahaha gd luck
At last! We have been waiting for so long for this project! Thank you Mr Matri!
O Arabs you sheep!!!
Greetings Amazigh people all over the world! Thanks of Amazigh people!

This is no game, shame on them!
I don't like those who denigrate the prophet.
Amar EL Deeb (wolf) you were eaten by the dog.
I congratulate you for your glorious revolution!
My lover is in prison. I love him to death. I miss him so much. If I only I can find someone to transmit these words to you. Idris, may God assist you and grant you patience God willing. It is a hardship and it will be over. Since you did nothing, don't be afraid. You left a good woman behind you. Pray, don't forget God, pray so that He will release you and all the oppressed, amen.
Those people who committed this act should be punished in Islam. Has Islam told them to assault girls and remove their clothes on the street?? Honestly, some girls wear very revealing clothes but this doesn't mean that we should treat them in this way as we should offer them advice…
Salam to people of reason and believe who understand what we say. By God, we are living in an era where falsehood has predominated the truth and secularism has predominated people with weak minds to the point that we see nakedness as something common. But those who cover their intimate parts, they are considered backward. This is what happened. These words are addressed to all young girls and to all Muslims. If we don't support each other in restoring our noble and virtuous morals, no one will support us. We have to cover our disgrace as no one will cover us if we don't cover ourselves.
Why did they beat her? They should have left her in peace. She is the one who is going to burn in the fire of hell. She is the one who is going to be punished by God not them. Moreover, there is no need to introduce freedom in this. She is wrong and they are wrong. May God guide us all!
Thank you, a nice topic!
Salam. I am a divorced woman. I have a daughter. She's going to get married. When I called her father, he doesn't want to attend her marriage. Is there any solution? Please reply. We don't have much time. Thank you!
I love Bigg so much. When you hold the microphone, you should hold the Moroccan drop. Muslim was my friend and substituted him. Take care, this is my friend.
My brother is married to the daughter of a neighbour. They have one daughter. Anyway, they are living with us. When he went to propose to her, she accepted to live with my family. But now they always quarrel. They reconcile and he beats her. Then she goes to her family's house, she makes a medical certificate and she comes back. In their latest dispute, she sued him. She wants to divorce but my brother doesn't want. He wants her to forgive him. He loves his daughter. I don't whether she can use pictures and medical certificates as evidence to take him to prison. What do we have to do? If you know any good lawyer, please reply!
Salam alikum. I am a married woman. I am informing of about my husband. He wants me to renounce to all my rights so that he can divorce me. But I don't want to divorce although I endure the violence he practices against me together with his family as I live with his family. My parents want me to divorce because he doesn't want me. What can I do? Is it me who should apply for divorce or remain like this? Please I want a solution as soon as possible. I am 20.
What is the religious rule of a man who deserts his wife for 2 years?
Salam alikum. I am a young woman, 31. I love a man who is married and has a child. He also loves me. We knew each other before he married. But we didn't marry. He doesn't want to divorce his wife to marry me. But she has many conditions such as relinquishing his house to her. But he doesn't want to leave her. We don't know what to do in order to marry. We want a solution so that we won't indulge in debauchery. We want a solution to be with each other legitimately. Can he marry me without the approval of the first wife because divorce requires a lot of time. We want a quick solution so that we won't indulge in debauchery. If we don't find a solution to be together legitimately, we will keep on living illegitimately all our life.
Salam. I'm 16. I am married and have serious problems with my husband. The first thing is that he always comes around drunk, beats me and doesn't support me. I just go to my mother. He doesn't respect me. I don't know how he spends his monthly salary. When I try to talk to him, he says "If you want me to be good, renounce to your dowry which we set at four million in the marriage contract." The last time he beat me, I fell unconscious and they took me to hospital. Now I'm suing him. Please tell me what to do. Looking forward to your reply!
I saw my husband coming out of a restaurant with a woman. I tried not to talk to them. But when he came home, I told him about that. He said he knew her before he married me, and that he had known her for seven years. He told me he wanted to marry her and he could marry without my approval. Please reply.
I have pictures which show the authorities acting like they are dealing with Jews; we are 100% Moroccan, we aren't Spanish. They say that we are Spanish. No, no, no, no, we are Moroccans; we are just claiming our rights, but they only deal with force and violence. The Moroccan state doesn't want anyone to know this therefore it says that there is nothing. But we all have very awful pictures. Where are human rights? I have very awful pictures.
If you are in Morocco, don't be surprised, you will see everything!
I address my special thanks to Mr Chakib Benmoussa as well as the departments of the ministry of the interior in all the kingdom. However, the question is how can local authorities deal with this widespread phenomenon in our country?
Rap Morocco forever. Long live Don Bigg.
Ok I am R-flow a.k.a Klam Lahloo (sweet words). R-flow is derived from my family name which begins with R. Ok Flow is a noun known by everyone.
I wish you success my sister. I support the idea of preparatory classes which you choose. I hope to get a score like you in physics this year, God willing!
I like Moroccan rap so much because it is the style in which I am comfortable with. It talks about problems of young people. For me, Bigg is the best rap singer in Morocco because he has interesting songs.
I wish her success!
The best rap singer is Muslim. You should bring pride or go away.
Salam. I am a Moroccan young man. I live in Italy. I want funding for an agricultural project for growing cattle, please. Thank you!
I would like to know how difficult this exam is next year God willing! I hope the exam will be slightly easy. Thank you!
Can you tell me if there is a second session for the first year of the baccalaureate or not please?
I say that the pass rate wasn't satisfactory this year at all. I wish success to those who will resit for the exam.
You killed us with your lies.
Look, people- find a solution.
Pray with me God to make things easy this year and see our names on the table of successful students, amen my Lord!
I thank Mohamed Choukri, because he has changed my life from a negative life to a positive life. He taught me how to struggle for my life and express my opinions. Thank you very much!
I am a girl and my mother has intestinal cancer. We hope to find help in treatment costs of the fatal disease. Please provide information about associations which contribute to costs in Rabat. Thank you.
I am Ibtissam from Asilah. My mother is sick. She has cancer. She was in a critical situation but God is the assistant and new medications. I wish quick recovery to all cancer patients. Don't forget to worship God. Thank you.
This is madness.
May God rest his soul...
Salam. I want to know please the symptoms of breast cancer because I feel recently something not normal in my breast. I wish quick recovery to all people infected by this serious disease and which threatens society as a whole.
Peace, mercy and blessings of God be upon you. I am Mohamed from the town of Midelt. I am 16. I suspect I have cancer about two weeks ago. I hope from God to find someone to help me
We hope the national team would restore its position at the world level whether it is led by a foreign or Moroccan coach. The most important is that they honour us in the face of enemies. I wish good luck to the sons of the Greens. Raja forever!
By God I am suffering. I have made many applications but nothing!!! I don't know whether I am Algerian or not. I have all the skills to become a police officer. But by God, it is hard luck. I have a university degree 2005 +. Let it as a secret. Every time my application is rejected. But I don't know why. I don't have the right to become a police officer! HOPE THERE IS SOME ONE WHO CAN ANSWER ME WITH ALL SINCERTY! I am Algerian.
Salam alikoum. My name is Zineb. I am Moroccan like you. I visited this site and read the opinions of all the students of the baccalaureate. Unfortunately, I also share the same opinion. The baccalaureate is widely sold in Morocco. I am one of the people whose baccalaureate was sold but don't forget that those who took it in this way don't deserve it. They won't do anything with it, and even if they do, it is illegitimate, they will be divulged. We hope that the situation of this country will improve; if it remains in this way it will never make any progress. The programme of 2008 is rubbish in rubbish, sorry my brothers.
As a student who passed the baccalaureate, I can say that all my friends cheated on the exam. Not a single student relied on himself.
Salam. Honestly, the courses of the baccalaureate are too numerous. And we have some courses which we haven't completed. But what can we do?
I want to know when will take the exam this year. They say that it will be on June 2, but we haven't yet finished the courses. There are at least five courses in every subject. How can we study all this? It is too much.
I think that Mawazine festival is a waste of money. These funds could have been exploited in the support of businesses and fighting unemployment. They can also be used to offer jobs to unemployed young people and to provide support in severe housing crises. This should be taken into consideration because Mawazine festival stirs strife because it brings no advantage for the country.
May God rest the soul of Kadhafi and martyrs in peace! You Libyans are all traitors!
In Islam conditions to marry one wife are the same conditions as in marrying the second wife, third and fourth. This condition is financial and moral ability. As to our Tunisian brothers, they have moved away from Islam. They don't fast in Ramadan and eat publicly. They reject Hijab. They don't accept polygamy because now they commit adultery freely and encourage tourism. But Most sure!y your Lord is watching; I will most certainly prevail, I and My apostles. They shall know to what final place of turning they shall turn back. Oh servants of God, you still don't want to wake up. The companions were defeated in the battle of Ouhoud because they had disobeyed the messenger, peace be upon him. But you I will tell you what Ibn Jobair said to Al Hajjaj "i am astonished at the patience of God with you and at your audacity to God".
You're the best actor, I wish you success in your artistic career. You are also a good actor in detective films, thank you.
Rachid Rachid Rachid El Ouali
Salam, I'm Farah from the city of El Houceima I hope that they will give us the address of Rachid El Ouali as he's presented us the best serials. Bye.
When you arrest two boys don't forget 1000 free Moroccan hackers who enter the world of music. Moroccans to death or hackers to death.
Salam. I am Moussa from Morocco. I would like to say no to corruption and no to adultery.
No to fraud!
In Morocco, the savagery of the state, silence shame, assault of Muslims, profanation of the Book of God, Muslim, sanctity of Qur'an and people.
Salam alikum. Corruption must be fought inside courts.
Where are you
I want the academy.
Salam alikum. My name is Hossain. I am 18. I am looking for a job.
Maroc Telecom are thieves in broad daylight.
Thank you Maroc Telecom. We want speed.
Honestly, Maroc Telecom is the best and I hope it will increase speed.
Thank you but you haven't offered free messages.
We the Moroccans do everything for Gaza.
There is no way for comment. They are all suspended to the palm tree. They fell like fruits fall from the palm tree.
The beautiful, the blond, the star, the flower, yes Hajar, you're the one I love so much, a kiss from me to Ahmed and Hamid, please please please, Mounia from Casa
I wish the program is purposeful and honest and not like the romantic serials in the academy!

Hi Jamel, how are you? My brother and I love you so much Jamel- Yasser.
Hajar, I love you so much and I'm one of your fans, I love you so much.
Certainly, they don't want Morocco to succeed, certainly there are many who envy us.
I want Moroccan films!
Hi I'm Nezha. I would like information on the earthquake of Al Hoceima.
Salam. I am Othman. Actually there are some students who want success to come to them. The baccalaureate is not something difficult. It just requires perseverance and seriousness. Thank you!

A good site
Hi! I am Nawal. I was very happy for the death of Kadhafi.
Hi! I think this year's programme is messy. Anyway, may God guide this people to understand us and show us some consideration!
There is no other God but Allah, Mohamed is the messenger of God. We are Muslims, we defend and fight for the cause of God and His messenger. God supports us and supports you my brothers in Islam.
this is a good and nice site I like it so much
Hi how are you sons of my country, are you ok? Good now we have a metro here, thanks to God, just in our country, we're in 2008 bye bye long live Alg
Which affluence are you talking about? May God guide you! Moroccan banks are robbers! We are in 2011 and there is no master card or visa which accepts payment via the net! Hhhh!
A terrible state. We have a huge difference between social classes in Morocco, so how can you expect people not to be indignant?
Salam, this site is nice and honestly I liked it so much. Is it possible to get in touch with the guys of this site, I have some things to add.
We will die with you for the country!
But God bless you! But I just want to see them. Very good...
I'm looking for help from the Nass El Ghiwane group in order to set up a musical band like Nass El Ghiwane.
Peace of God be upon everyone. I wish to Nass El Ghiwane more fame and success.
Thank you Mohamed VI!
This is not a country. We must all immigrate and run away. There is nothing. Kamal says to you there is nothing. Long live Harga (illegal immigration) and illegal immigrants. Down with plunderers, justice, like dogs, may God curse them. These are bastards.
What are conditions set by Social Security Fund?
My name is Mohamed. I study in the fourth year of the secondary and I have passed. I left school one year ago. I want to go back to apply for vocational training. I want you to tell me available subjects in vocational training. I want to choose mechanics. Tell necessary conditions in vocational training. Reply.
I am Zouhair from the city of Fekih Ben Saleh. I want to move from Meknes University of law to the Fes University of law. I need help with that.
My name is Soufiane from the city of Settat. I advise everyone who is 17 to complete their studies or go to adequate vocational training in order to have a nice life in future.
I am Awatif from the town of Oued Zem. I want to ask about the branch of accounting, is it better? I am confused. Thank you.
I want to tell you, my brothers, I have a problem. I have been accepted to study mechanics in the qualification centre. I have repeated the baccalaureate and don't know what to do. Reply brothers, do I sit again for the baccalaureate or study mechanics with a qualification level?
There is no other God but God, Mohamed is the messenger of God.
I didn't want a Saudi to take it. I wanted Michel or Bassma.
Morocco, Algeria, Mauritania and Libya forever!
Yes, I agree.
Happy Achoura!
Happy Achoura!
Eid Mubarak for all Morocco
Salutation to Amazigh people of Libya. We should know who have initiated this revolution. It was Amazighs. However, Arab nationalists prefer themselves because Arabs are rotten people in their thoughts. "The Arabs of the desert are the worst in unbelief and hypocrisy" from people of Fes to the Midlle East!
All parties suffer from the senility of its members, they should recruit young people.
You have forgotten Moroccan junior and senior champion in '73. He is always present and he is still training abroad. Despite all that, he wasn't fortunate enough to join the Moroccan team.
We have an excellent judo coach, Hassan El Baz. He is great.
Congratulations Nadir. But I love Amel Bouchoucha so much because she is the daughter of my country. Bouchoucha, I love you so much. You honoured Algeria so much.
I love so much Nader. He is the son of my country. There are poor people and I am poor.
I am Tarik from Fes and want to play a role with Rachid Al Ouali.
Morocco forever, it is the best.
God is the greatest, Chahata is dead.
They don't have the right to ask the girl to wear hijab because if they wear hijab, they should wear it with conviction not with fear. As for clothing, the state has granted freedom. As they have freedom of the individual, they have freedom and also these girls have freedom. Leave punishment to God the Almighty.
May God guide her and guide them!
I die for Chada! Honestly this is a nice colour for a blonde!
Moroccan traditions are much better!
May God grant you long life Cheikh and grant you health. We miss you. I have been sending you greetings for one year through Aamirouch Kakou.
Praise be to God for the salvation of Libya from Pharaoh of Libya! O Lord, unite the word of Muslims until they liberate Jerusalem!
I'm very happy with this occasion and thanks to all the viewers
By God this is inacceptable, o terrorism, the way you killed him!
I am with al-Qaeda, I ask God to grant them success in all parts of the world. We will kill the hypocrites wherever they are. Allah Akbar
The first law that should be adopted is to make a good structure for all roads of the kingdom, which are in a bad state, with holes which we might mistake for wells. Mr Abdelkrim Ghellab, this is a call (spend some money on national roads, these holes which fill them). Imagine that money is spent on police reports. You want to make a profit without spending. This is how genuine Fes people are!!
FAR for ever, FAR to the tomb.
I agree with Mr Obaha that the honour of the girl is her life and that parents should not be indulgent about this issue because God the Almighty endowed woman with her honour. Every woman must preserve this custody until she is married legally.
Salam. I study in the second year of the baccalaureate physical sciences. In the first year, I had a score of 14.65 and 13.53 in the regional exam. I would like to join preparatory classes and want to ask if there are sites to communicate with responsible sides about them. Thank you!
Salafists are the most corrupt people and they claim Islam.
I am from the town of Zagoura. I study in the first year experimental sciences. I am a lazy student. I study with turbulent students Redoane Mlodne, Khalid Liazidi, Smail Bousta and Baasous Lboudani. Thank you!
I say it openly, the Polisario Front should, it's not a State and not a party, we want it to accept autonomy because it's the suitable solution for the dispute of the Sahara. If the Moroccan Sahara wants war, it can't make it.
I am a student in the first of the baccalaureate, sciences and electrical technology, Al Khawarizmi High School. I would like to ask you if electricity is part of mathematical sciences.
Salam. I am now studying in ISTA accounting. Please my sister, don't be worried about this because studies are everything. Don't commit my mistake which made me lag far behind. But don't forget your education, you shouldn't go to Oujda and go astray. Ok, I am a girl from Bouarfa. Transmit my greetings to residents of Jrada from Hasi Blal to Lrmbli.
I'm Ayoub from Casa, I love Fatin, Farid and Hamid.
Salam alikum. I am Ghizlane from Casa. I study in the first year of the baccalaureate in arts. I don't want this subject but it has no future prospects. I want to change it and study sciences. However, they say it is impossible. But I can't study something I am not convinced about. I want the ministry of education to find solutions to such problems.
Hi! I am a student in the third year of the elementary. I want to choose the field of technology. However I live in Jerada and the high school which offers this subject is in Oujda. My family supports me and encourages me. But I am scared to go and then regret it. I want please a solution as soon as possible!
I love you Hajar. Sahraoui forever.
I love Hajar Adnane so much.
Studio 2M is nice.
Hajar, I love you so much. You are the most beautiful Moroccan girl. I wish you success and hope to hear your latest work.
Long live Hajar, the beauty of the girls.
Bassma, I love you. You're a star forever.
I am looking for a suitable training, I chose farming but I am confused.
Peace, mercy and blessings of God be upon you.
Allow me to say that Anapec agency in Tangier doesn't help young people to get jobs. It is better that this agency be closed. This is a shame and unacceptable! My brothers, everything in Anapec of Tangier is through favouritism and bribery. This is a shame and disgrace. I am revealing the truth so that all Morocco is aware of what happens. This is my opinion and I have the right to express it.
Salam. I am a student, 20. I passed the bac. However, I can't complete my studies.
Everything true is in the scholar.
The baccalaureate exams have become like auctions. You find that they are leaked one day before the exam, regardless of who they are. We have to change mindsets if we want to progress and develop our country of wealth for the greedy.
Salam. Please help me find a job with a decent and respectable salary please! I am mother of two. I would like to help my brother with the living costs.
Salam. I am Maria. I will sit for the baccalaureate in SVT this year. I am very scared about the exam. Pray for me! May God grant success to everyone who will sit for the baccalaureate, amen!
I hope from God the pass rate this year will be high and there will be no discrimination in correction as there are some students who don't deserve to pass but pass. This is caused by supervisors who leak the baccalaureate. May God bring all the good!
Salam alikum. I am looking for a job. I have a problem with the diploma of the cooperative. I did everything trying to find a job. I registered in Anapec. I went several times and they sent me back. Isn't this a shame that I become ruined? I do dressmaking. I do training, I have a black belt. I prey God and ask you to help me. I need a job in anything.
Peace of God be upon you my brothers. I would like to address a call to baccalaureate students. The sky doesn't rain gold or silver. We have to work hard and be ready before the exam. The exam of the baccalaureate is a surprise exam. Wish success to everyone, God willing. I will also sit for the baccalaureate exam this year. There is nothing impossible in this life. One should not rely on cheating. Good luck.
I wish success to everyone. I am a student in the 2nd year of the baccalaureate literature. I have problem with reviewing lessons of history and geography. I don't know what to do. Please help me!
I would like to make phone calls abroad.
I wish Houda success in her future and wish the same to everyone! Thank you very much! I am your friend Salma Reda. Many congratulations!
Morocco is one of the most beautiful countries. There are many historical old sites.
They're only good at that, with this new government Morocco will become the last country in this world.

Greetings!
I want a job of any kind.
Hi Fnair, you're, by God, great.
I greet Fnair and tell them I want your msn.
I am a citizen from the city of Fès. I want to participate in acting. I am 18. I love acting. I am an actor.
There are some who find a job but don't have the qualifications to do it. But there are some who have qualifications but can't find a job. This is why we are backward.
I wish you good luck.
Hi Fnair, I'm Rayan Abdelghani fromthe province of Errachidia. I repeat that I like Fnair since I heard them for the first time in Ajial programme. I tell you take care of yourselves and prepare a good album like 'Yed El Hanna'
I'm Keltoum from Essaouira, honestly, I like listening to your songs and I wish you success.
I want special work because I am a child of 15.
Salam alikum. I am 24. I have studied up to the baccalaureate level. I have a diploma in word processing. I have worked in many fields, even in a restaurant. Now I'm looking for any job. I just want to have a good salary because I have a diploma and I take care of the studies of my brothers. I want a job in Morocco or abroad. I just want to work with my hands, and with honour. I thank you very much if you find me a job, even with foreigners, because they know how to evaluate work and offer good salaries. But how can I communicate with you?
Moamer is the dog of dogs and ended like a dog.
A very nice topic
My opinion about this topic is that the Sahara is Moroccan and will always be Moroccan.
Long live CABBA
Tunisia as usual.
I'm Soufian Chaaouan I love Farah Al Massaaoudi
I love you so much and would like to see you the beautiful Tunisian
Good luck Latifa, the nicest Tunisian artist.
Inchallah God will grant you success in your artistic career, don't forget Tunisians you're Tunisian
you know what,guys? you're just talking nonsense.I just am wondering where the problem is as long as everybody is happy with that nice comfortable rank. Everyone WANTS to get money without pain. Have a look at lotto/kino ... agents and you'll be shocked to see gamblers of all sorts(from nicely necktied guys to flea-market buttock-holed trousered guys. Everyone wants it EASY. Human development is everyone's concern; it's not just the government's affair. Are we really the kind of people who want and intend to develop? To my knowledge, I DON'T THINK SO. Everyone, somewhere, in a way is negligent, selfish, time-wasting and irresponsible. This gives way to organised anarchy that all of us practise but no one accepts once he feels targeted or victimised. "Surely Allah does not change the condition of a people until they change their own condition."
Salam. I am Sanae from Morocco. I wanted to be a student in the Maghreb Star Academy because it is my hobby. I hope that you will invite me. Thank you Star Academy.

May God protect you. This is all I can say.
I love you so much Haifa. You sing well but don't care about people. You're nice and people are jealous.
Salam. I would like to know the prices of houses in this project and the number of regions which will benefit from this project. Please reply!
Salam. A special greeting to you. I want a social housing. I don't have a house. Can I go to your office in Taroudant?
I want a house, because I don't have a house. I live with my father and mother on the upper floor of their house. I have a child of 3. Please help me!
Haifa is so gorgeous, amazing and the best proof is that all girls are eager to be like Haifa... Many people had plastic surgery and it failed they still ugly....Haifa is terrific.....good luck 4 u haifa ,you're the best ...

I don't like violence.
This is good. But has she succeeded thanks to her efforts or something else? Who can say whether she has bought it because in Morocco just show them money and they will respond ****.
Very good article, very great and varied. Will I find my reply here? I want a reply to my email address.
By God, these Moroccan officials are treacherous. It is the ministry which proofreads not the teachers.
You deserve the title and you're the best star I saw in the academy. You have honoured Morocco. We wish you good luck in your artistic career.
May God rest your souls, I want the address of a psychiatrist, this is urgent, by God!
I love Bassma and Yahya so much. Bassma, you're the star of the academy 6, but Abdelaziz.

My name is Mimoun Ouachikh from Nador. My problem is that I failed in the baccalaureate exam because I had a low grade in the regional exam. I applied as a free candidate. I hope that the exam will be easy. I wish success to all Moroccans. I hope to pass because it is my sole dream in this life.

Salam alikum. As long as Zaki Badou is not here, the national team is null.
I want Bado Zaki to lead the national team.
Hi to the great team which bites!
I have a diploma in aluminum. However, I can't find a job in the north. I regret so much having dropped out of school. Advice for God's sake, studies are everything. If you need a worker, you can phone me.
Zaki!!!
Don't you understand Arabic? We want Zaki.
Salam to all Moroccans in charge of the federation. I tell them, by God, it is a shame! Don't they have the national spirit? Oh Lord, this is enormous! Is there no consideration for the nation and the people who die for their national squad? We want Zaki x100000000000000000! Whatever you do, Zaki will always remain Zaki in the blood of Moroccans!
My name is Nabil from Tamsaman. I am 19. I dropped out of school 3 years ago. I would like to study in the vocational training centre. I don't know how to register.
Salam alikum. I'm from the Moroccan community living abroad. I hope you will honour us this year. I'm one of the fans of Badou Zaki. I love Morocco and football so much. We hope that the national team will be like it was with Hajji, Chamakh, Zairi, Karkori, Moha, Yaacoubi, Ouaddou, Jarmouni, Alloudi, Tarik Seqtioui. Long live Morocco! Kelaa Seraghna.
Oh Zaki, men, don't you understand? Respect the Moroccan people! Give him some time and patience and you will see. Zaki, forever, forever!
I liked vocational training because it gave me hope in life. I chose FCC, commercial refrigeration and air-conditioning. I hope to work with you when I will get a diploma.
Well done guys, God bless you, bless your hands and bless the hand of Sidahmed Oulid Cheraga.
I want you to show me please a way of making Sfifa and knots.
Hi everybody, I want to say that you all deserve, I want to say to Ahmed you have won the hearts of Moroccans with your attitude towards the Moroccans with you Hajar, Hamid and Farah. Thank you.
I am a married woman to an Algerian man. When I wanted to record my children in the civil status, I found difficulties. How can I register them???

Praise be to God, thanks to His grace good deeds are accomplished. God is the greatest! There is no other God but Allah! A Tunisian man who is proud to see Islam returning strongly to his country.
I witness there is no other God but Allah, Mohamed is the messenger of God.
Are these Americans mad?
I will sacrifice my mother and father for you o messenger of God, peace and blessings of God be upon you, peace and blessings of those in the heavens and earth on you! Peace and blessings of God be upon you light of guidance!
O my beloved Mohamed, the best of all creatures is Mohamed. Peace and blessings of God be upon Your chosen prophet. I will sacrifice my blood and soul for you beloved one!
Except the messenger of God! I will sacrifice my mother, father and children for you messenger of God!
Elections in Morocco are totally ineffective because they were corrupted by bribery.
Salam alikum. I am a student in the third year of the secondary and I don't know which speciality to choose. I am confused. Please send me a reply as soon as possible.
Why do they treat prisoners like this?
God has cursed wrongdoers in all the books. Now you are ashamed of your religion. You look at Islam from a narrow corner. Why don't you look at the developed Islamic country which has preserved its Islam, morals, and principles such as Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia? Any girl who has a body and doesn't protect it is cheap. If you have no shame, do whatever you want!
Peace, mercy and blessings of God be upon you. Eh Muslims, I advise you to take care of your dear nation in view of illiteracy and poverty hosted by Morocco.
Believe me if I tell you that I am a girl but when I see a girl wearing a short dress, I feel repulsed. I wish to see all girls wearing decent clothing.
This is rubbish and it is unfair for those 20 billions to be wasted away. If only they gave every Moroccan 600 millions, they will have enough money left and the problem of unemployment. And if you are unable to fulfil ideas yourselves why are you calling foreigners?
I am a fan of the band. Nass Elghiwane is the first band to have raised the Moroccan and Palestinian causes in the Arab world just like Bob Marley spoke out for his own. I listened to this band and I wish them a long prosperous life. We have them in our hearts and we cannot afford to lose them. May the Mercy of the Lord be on the soul of late Boujemaa and the others live longer!
My name is Mehi. I am from Rabat. I love Nas Elghiwane!
I am a big fan of Nas Elghiwane!
I'm a fan of Nass El Ghiouane, Lemchaheb, Jil Jilala, Siham, Lersad groups, may Allah help them.
I love Nas ElGhiwane band!
The Casablanca Wydad club is the best team I like the club so much, its coach and the players.
The topic of nationality has a high sensitivity for the Moroccan citizenship, culture and origins. However, let's ask this question: what has the Moroccan nationality granted us? Only the national identity card. The nationality has made us die in Africa. Not all of Africa, just Morocco. We cannot preserve the nationality for people who don't want it. But in the nationality law, it is impossible to remove the nationality of the Moroccan person unless he/she does acts which violate the order of the state. I honestly have nothing to do with it. I need an American or Israeli citizenship which will grant me value in this world and some Euros because the day of the dirham has gone.
Morocco forever, looool hh
Morocco always in the blood.
A very interesting site.
Salam, how are you? You're a nice girl.
This is something good. They cohabit with the Jews and all foreigners. May God preserve Morocco for us and preserve us for it.
This is what you Moroccans are good at: witchcraft and sorcery. This is what has always made you backward. There is no power and no will but from God the Almighty. Ask for the assistance of God; enough absurdities and myths.
Salam. How are you? I want some information about work of women in the Maghreb and all parts of the world.
Congratulations for passing with that grade! Tell us more about extra tutorial hours and teachers because the majority says that private tutorial hours with teachers help you in the score you get. Thank you!
Peace and mercy of God be upon you. I am a married woman. I am two months pregnant. I have twins. I have endured problems from the family of my husband when they heard news about my pregnancy. The latter asks me not to take the road as there is a lot of risk for me. He asks me to take medicines and not travel before 10 days. As a result of this, the sister of my husband was angry at me, that I tell lies especially because she is a midwife, that her brother should not travel alone. I have traveled with him. I have endured so much after that. I am still in a sickness leave. At the beginning, I accepted to live my mother-in-law. It is my husband who rents the house. Now my mother-in-law no longer wants to live with us because her daughters no longer want to see me. My husband doesn't want to live far from his mother. Even if I haven't done any wrong to her or her daughters. Even my husband doesn't get in touch with me even though I am pregnant. I need his help. Now they have left me alone and sick in order to spend three days at his sister's. He asks me to bear all the costs of pregnancy. He has never given me money. It is always for me to spend my own money. Now I need your help. What should I do? Thank you.
Congratulations to you my sister Houda! Wish you more hard work and perseverance to achieve your dream and ambitions. We wish you success. This is how young people should be. Congratulations, congratulations!
I think that there is a lot of cheating on the baccalaureate in Morocco. Passing rates are dropping and this is why as the sister Faty said, some people who don't deserve to pass take the baccalaureate. Thank you.
Salam. I think honestly that some people pass the baccalaureate who don't deserve to. We want the samples for this year's exam and I want to know the passing grade point average this year.
I condemn the odious act of these parliamentarians who allege to be the voice of the people and serve their interests. This is a shame! Haven't they considered the law before approving it? There should be infrastructure, awareness-raising campaigns for pedestrians and say if there are any sanctions against them. Will we be equal with those who adopted the law? Will they also abide by this law and there would be no one above the law? Or shall we witness again the famous saying 'the first who violates law are legislators'. Thank you!
Salam alikum. I will sit for the second session. I ask God to grant me success and grant success to everyone! I ask God, and hope the officials will make the exam easy! I'm not ready for another shock!
Salam. Shame on you! Why is it that we prepare intensively, and in the end, we have to sit for the second session!
Salam alikum. I am a girl who studies in the baccalaureate from the region of Al Houceima. This year I will sit for the exam. I hope from God it will be easy. Pray for me. My hope is to pass the baccalaureate. If I don't pass, my life is lost. My hope will be lost. It's my only hope in this life, because my relatives despise me and I am alone. Pray for me; may God protect you!
I wish everyone success on all exams, not just the bac!
You are all right, because if you don't negotiate with them, you won't pass. There are many lazy students who pass with bribery. May God guide them!
This is not reasonable. I am sorry for the victims. Finally, where is justice? They must punish officials who take the funds of the people.
Thank you very much for these topics. I study accounting. I completed the exams, but I'm very scared about the results.
Pardon me, we are Muslims. The pillars of Islam are well-known. Anyone who breaches one of them knows the ruling of Islam about it. I ask you by God the Greatest, Lord of the Greatest Throne to fear God. If you don't fear God, have some respect for us at least. There is a sharia and a law. If you don't respect sharia, respect law at least. From God we are and to God we shall return! God will rule out between us. "And one leg will be joined with another: That Day the Drive will be (all) to thy Lord! "
Congratulations to Libya for the liberation! However, the demise of Kadhafi in this way is unacceptable even if he was a criminal and dictator because finally he is a human being and His creator will punish him.
I'm Sanae Snoussi from the city of Oujda. I like Rachid Al Wali so much. I wish him a happy life full of success. I hope that he will write me as well. I wish to take a photo with him. I like so much the films where he's the hero. Bye.
Salam. I think that the problem is not with the clothes. There are cases of women who wear hijab and who were victims of harassment. This is sufficient evidence that the problem is with such men who can't even control themselves. They should go and see their sisters and mothers how they dress, then they come to control other girls. They are just showing manliness with others. If manliness means assaulting a girl who is helpless I tell them: may God curse your manliness o bunch of repressed men!
I like your movies so much. Very nice. May God grant you success. I like you because you're very humble.
Stop this impropriety.
Salam I love the movies of Rachid El Ouali, nice films and also Abdelah Didan.
Morocco go away, the Sahara isn't yours.
Peace of God be upon you. Please reply because I want to benefit from this loan of 5000 dirhams because I need it so much. What are necessary papers because I want to buy a house with monthly installments of 500 dirhams? Ok?
Salam alikum brothers. I would like to know what would be the case if someone doesn't don't pay his small loans?? Would would they do to him? I am waiting for your reply brothers, please, thank you!
My job is a cameraman. I would like to buy a camera and image tools and install them at home. I would like to benefit from this loan. What can I do in order to benefit from the loan?
The Sahara is 100% Moroccan.
This is a shame.
Raja is a football school, whatever it does.
I don't know my brother if you're talking about reality or just saying nonsense. Long live Morocco.
I want people to live in peace. Thank you!
It is an important project. I want to benefit from a private house at an affordable price because I have a low income. Please help me. Thank you very much.
Hi Chnaoua, are you well? MCA is a strong team. The last time they won I was overwhelmed with joy. That is good. With the will of God we will finish like this. Oh Lord let's go up this year. Long live Mouloudia of Algiers, the evidence of our strength is that we went up in 1921 and we'll continue like this. Long live MCA Chnaoua.
I lost my sight in a road accident. Is there any solution for me, please? And there are scars in my face. I can't tell though because I can't see anything.
Salam. I am Moroccan and Arab. Haven't you woken up Arabs yet and understood that western countries want to stir strife among Arabs by all means? This is because Arab countries are beginning to expect a successful future, God willing! I hope from Arabs will sit down and ask yourself. You can substitute your father only with a step-father.
Bado Zaki.
Happy Ramadan to all Moroccans. I hope that Maroc Telecom will offer a mobilezone.
Happy Eid!
Belhadj, Belhadj, I die for you! May God protect you!
I am a Moroccan young man. I sat for the baccalaureate exam. I don't know why teachers treat us savagely.
Salam alikum.
Salam, Hajar you're a star, my greetings to Ahmed and Khairi as well even if he had left I don't forget him
I am a woman who suffers from over-sized breasts. Many doctors advised me to undergo surgery to reduce their volume but I don't know where to go, please guide me.
Salam alikum. My problem is the following. I am married and have one daughter. My husband was in France but didn't register my daughter in the civil status. He left us and to this day she is not registered. I addressed the court but it was just a waste of time. They said it is compulsory to bring the husband. How can I wait for him and for how long? Can I register her in my name? If you have anyone who has any information, please reply as soon as possible. I have been facing this problem for 4 years. I am fed up by God!
How are you? Thank you for this work you carried out.
I want to say that Derb Omar is one of the best markets in Morocco, but it would be good if they made some improvements.
I don't agree with this opinion.
Derb Omar is one of the biggest streets and best markets in the country.
Thank you! I wish you more success and to everyone who contributed to creating this site!
All Arabs are worthless except those who were spared by God!
By God, Lemerre was wrong when he ignored Zairi. We all hope that he brings Zamama, Boussofa and let's not forget the super Hamdaoui.
What happened are Arab hands which are trying to play with Algeria, all the Arab rulers don't have one policy in this field, we will defend this dear nation, long live Algeria, and long live Algeria, long live Bouteflika, the Arab leader without rival.
King of the rai will always remain always the king. I have nothing to say, you're great!!!!!
Khaled you are really great.
Congratulations to Algeria.
In reality, a girl cannot marry at the age of 9 because there is a big difference between girls today and girls 15 centuries ago in the physical side. However, we should let this sheikh justify well why he has issued this fatwa because our problem is that we aren't good at listening.
People of today!
All those who replied to the sheikh haven't come with a scientific debate.
I want to become with Nass El Ghiwane.
I am Ghiwani and will remain Ghiwani. I thank Nass El Ghiwane for their new tape and wish them eternal continuity.
Club Africain oh state.
I am very happy with Nass El Ghiwane.
Nass El Ghiwane is the best band. They gave pride to this country. Well done.
Many comments, a lot of articles but the action is weak. What do we reap from such lectures except ink on paper? Some might say that such forums are important. However, the most important is to offer an alternative. This alternative in my opinion is moralization of public life. Often some talk about sexual harassment against women and they have instituted sanctions. However, this has remained without result because they didn't solve the source of the problem which is failure to wear hijab. If all women were to wear hijab, there would have been no harassment and I will assure you that the rate of marriage will increase God willing! Moreover, marriage is interest. All Muslims know the story of the master of all creatures when he married Khadija. The result was the great love for her even she was 15 years older than him. They shared no feelings before marriage, there were interests. In the past, man used to marry two, three or four women, so there was no way left for unveiled women. Even young men used to marry women older than them for their money or good manners. But in our times, when a young man marries a woman older than him, when she accepts him, the society considers this a shame. When she marries him, she wouldn't allow him to marry a second wife. There are so many divorced or widowed women who wish to marry legitimately but can't. There are women who would even kill her femininity or follows the way of depravity. I have a heart full of grief for the Umma of Iqra (the nation of reading) because most of them are ignorant and chained by traditions of the ancestors as if they are trying to say what the disbelievers used to say to our prophet "Enough for us is that which we found our fathers following," as if we have returned to the pre-Islamic era.
Salam alikum. I am a young man, 25. I work in Italy. However, my situation is very miserable. I fell ill and had a surgery. Now I want to go back to my country because I am tired of this country. I would like to set up a project for traditional ironwork. I don't have any capital. I need help, please!
I am Ahmad Sabbar. I want to know if you sent me family allocations for retirement.
My problem is that I am registered but I haven't received allocations since 2008.
No to the new constitution.
I want to know the number of my points.
I am a young girl who has the baccalaureate degree in arts. I applied for many general training schools last year but I don't know why I was not accepted in any of them. I hope that I will be accepted this year so that I won't waste the year especially in the specialized centre of hotel catering and restaurants. I have one observation, the cost of the file this year is 30 dirhams, this is too much. Thank you.
Great! Please continue such successful work!
Where did you bring this statistic in which you said that 28% of Moroccans speak Tamazight? Or do you publish what you want? Instead of saying 78%, you lie to ignorants who know nothing in this country.
For me, vocational training centres are the shortest way for the sons of the people to work and if they don't find job they can do little jobs.
I agree with the opinion of colleagues about this topic.
Salam. How are you? I wish success to all Moroccans. I was also a student but praise be to God I studied in the vocational training. I got my diploma and now I am working, praise be to God. I wish all the good. Those who want to achieve something will reach it but they must work for it. Ok, bye.
Salam. I am a young girl. I am 22. I didn't get the baccalaureate. So I chose vocational training in which I found myself. There is just one problem. I am not fluent in French.
The best thing in these novels is that they take the readers in spaces of knowledge though the carefully and professionally selected word. I love this writer for her beautiful writing and precise story telling in an unmatched literary style. My beautiful Ahlam, here is a warm kiss from one of your big female fans for your superb work. Many thanks from Saida in Holland.
Go to sleep ! There is no enterprise or anything. I am happy to participate in this very good and interesting site. I liked it so much; my question is how much money is necessary for this enterprise?
I will tell you one thing, we support Kadhafi whether he is oppressed or oppressing. This is what you want to hear!
Salam alikum. I want to learn Dutch but I found it a bit difficult. What can I do?
Salam. Jawad from the city of Khouribga. I have an agricultural land. I would like to set up a project for cattle-growing. What is available aid by the state in the agricultural field? Thank you!
You can't compare Moroccans to Egyptians the robbers and criminals. We love the Algerian people.
Hi Basma. I love you so much. You are the star God willing. You will always be a star, a big kiss to you.
I love Bassouma if only everyone votes for you. You deserve the title of the star academy 6. Ok, vote, thank you.
Morocco is lost.
I want to tell to all Moroccans please Bassma needs your votes.
Salam alikum. I am Bahija, 27. Honestly, I am very happy for the foundation of "Youth parliament" under the patronage of his majesty Mohamed VI may God assist and support him. With this, I hope to be among young participants in this parliament in order to take care of the problem of young people. This is because I love politics of Morocco and hope to integrate them deeply, give advice and help the sons of Morocco in the future and coming generations God willing. I also hope that my request will be considered by concerned authorities and by the body organizing this parliament. I am ready to serve my country because I love it and respect it so much.
The idea of youth parliament is meaningless.
These are calumnies and lies. God willing, this is evidence that your malice is over.
Salam Diaa people are happy with you we wish you all happiness and congratulations to Saad. Sing to me Bombo hhh
I like so much star academy program and hope that there will be other programs similarto it. Thank you.
I want to welcome the initiative, but it is devoid of interest because it is nothing compared to Lebanon Star Academy, whether in terms of budget, fame or level. There is no way to compare. Long live Star Academy.
Hi how are you? I am Hatim. I am from Morocco. I am very fond of you. May God grant success.
Hi, how are you? I would like to know the results of the bac exams.
This is very interesting to me, thank you.
Hi how are ou. This festival is nice, great. Ok, anyway, I will see nice movies in the cinema ok, goodbye, bye.
Those who aren't well-informed about the disease shouldn't write about it.
Blessed Ramadan.
God willing, problems between the two countries will be solved!
Islam in our time is just a title without implementation. We know what is forbidden and we keep silent about it. We know there is injustice but we just watch it happen. We have no feelings. Arabs aren't united. This is what brings them this in the end. I am Arab and Muslim. I call upon my brothers to think about our oppressed Arab brothers.
I like Jihad with Al Qaeda.
I am an amateur wrestler.
Hello to all the Amazigh people in the world.
When Zaki has gone, by God, you will never succeed the national team brings foreigners who take away your money.
Nice that's it
Happy Eid I hope that 2008 will bring you health and peace inchallah.
Enjoy it sons of my country!
I want Alloudi, Ouaddou, and Ronaldo to play with the national team.
Salam. My heart is always Gaza. Long live Bahara beach.
What is the use of orienting young people to politics if the latter is only used in talking? We need action, the right to belong to this country, to dream of security. It is not necessary to be oriented to learn how to speak. But we need to be taught how to live amidst all the rubbish surrounding us. We need someone to cleanse our consciences, someone to adjust our flaws, someone to plant cleanliness around us. The legacy of years can't be removed by words. Build for clean souls, maybe they will be a better basis but not through the art of words but with cleanliness of minds. Let's make this our dream to a solid basis with values and morals. A passer-by.
Hi. How are you? Thank you Marwan, you have lifted the head of Moroccans.
Salam alikum. I want to ask about those who aren't registered on voters' lists can still register and get a voter card? As you know the elections are close on 12/06, the day of voting. Please reply.
I am Rabab from Casablanca. I am a fan of Marouane Chamakh. I wish him success and goodness. I am so much proud of him and admire him so much.
I love Fulla and Naima Ababsa in the duo "el djazair wa chahida" written and composed by the sheikha of weddings Naima, of whom we don't talk much. Naima Ababsa wrote for sheikhs of our country such as dzayer bnat laarach el kaima, elly baghi yeksi martou etc… Finally she is the one who deserves most to be the daughter of Abdelhamid Ababsa, the singer of the authentic heritage, excellent musician and interpreter of our rich heritage. May God protect you Ababsa girls, we love you.
Lovers of traditional dresses!
I can't live the life
I'm asking when is Ramadan.
I am a university student I quite understand the difficulties of teachers in remote areas but I hope to be a teacher in the countryside because I miss it. Thank you.
Salam. How are you? Cheb Bilal forever. Morocco forever.
I'm Ghizlane I wish to Khayri good luck and I'm fond of him, inchallah you're the star, I love you so much Khayri, a big kiss to all the students
Hajar the beautiful, the princess of the academy, you, Farah and Hamid are the princes of the academy.
In fact, it's a nice channel which offers a good opportunity to Maghreb young people, you've made a mistake by giving the students the right to make a decision among them, that's not nice.
O Lord guide everyone!
By god, kiss kiss
Salam. I am Nisrine. I am also crazy for Cheb Bilal. For me he is the best rai singer because he talks about reality in his songs. I love Bilal to death. Long live Bilal.
Cheb Bilal is a great singer. I hope to see him directly. I wish to talk to him via chat. I listened to most of his songs.
Robllllllla forever.
I am abndoulitiki from Casablanca. Raja forever. I like Cheb Bilal so much, by God. But I am sorry because I never saw him standing with me. May be I want to be with Cheb Bilal, by God. We Moroccans like him, by God. But I am always happy with Cheb Bilal. I have an ipod and always listen to Bilal, the songs of Bilal "oudima ma amine yarbi amin", "abali", "chouf chouf", "kiwahran kimacasa", "cheriki", "mane doire ldoulare", "souhila" and "jet palazare". Morocco, by God, likes Cheb Bilal.
Zaki and the team forever! But in the team, everyone relies on the other, they have to be in harmony.
The nicest designs! I can't see any nicer designs than the authentic Moroccan traditional dresses. Anyone who says the opposite is a liar. I hope to participate with you if possible.
Amar Ezahi is the veteran of Algerian songs who replaces El Anka.
Libya without Kadhafi isn't Libya.
Thank you our sheikh Amer Ezzahi! May God grant you long life!
I like you sheikh and when I listen to you I reach my favorite mood. May God grant you a long life!
Amar is the sheikh of seikhs and father of the poor men. May God grant him long life and protect him, God willing!
Thank you our sheikh, may God grant you a long life!
Morocco is fighting in its great and distinguished performance. I advise every one that smoking causes cancer. I advise all the people.
I think that the policy of Morocco is a strict policy. We know that Morocco is a democratic country which respects others.
Cannabis boosts the economy of the country. With it, we buy arms and F16 aircraft.
This depravity we see in our society is the result of many reasons which can be summed up in two main factors. The first is the weak religious motivation. The second is the absence of the role of parents. For a father who lets his daughter go out in front of him in such clothes, what is his main role? Is it not education? So where is education? Finally, we ask God to guide us to all the good!
Can you tell me why does Mawazine festival coincide with the exams? Stop manipulating young people. God suffices me and He is the best mandate.
Salam alikum. In my opinion, expressions like "this is Amzabe", "this is Arab", "this is Chaoui" and so on, with these sayings Arab countries are turning us and they are deriding us. For me, there is no difference between Arab and Kabylie. The most important is that we all say there is no other God but God. This is my opinion.
This is a waste of money. I think that if Morocco invested these funds, we would have made big progress instead of wasting them away in rubbish.
Shame on all Arabs! This is serious!
Joudya I love you to death. I am Sonia from Azilal. Your songs are great.
I am a young man. I am training with my small family. I want to access the job market in any interesting field. Thank you! Greetings.
djamel is the star
jobs.
I am 28. I have studied up to the baccalaureate level. I study in the Red Crescent. I have done some training. I am looking for a job.
I want a job.
Salam. This is good and in the interest of young people.
I am looking for a job. I am 17.
I want to work in any job. I am 17.
Peace, mercy and blessings of God be upon you. I thank everyone who contributed to the success and development of this site. I hope you will realize more in the future God willing. I wish success to everyone.
Salam alikum. Concerning the baccalaureate, the problem is with the educational system in Morocco which has become very deteriorated. Pupils who passed the baccalaureate with a score of 10 doesn't mean they are lazy students. The cause is what was said above. The best evidence is that I had a score of 16 and the first rank in the exam class but in spite of this I passed the baccalaureate with a score of 11. What does this mean? I want a reply please!
I would like to know passing rate this year. I wish you success.
The problem about the baccalaureate is learning courses by heart.
Praise be to God.
I would like to say that I wish success to anyone in the baccalaureate in all levels.
God willing the Tunisian national team will do well especially Darragi and Lmsekni.
My name is Abadenabi from the high school Al Manssour Edahbi. Is my country democratic with supporting evidence?
Thank you for this site. It is very interesting. Long live all Maghreb people.
That's a shame, a shame, by God.
Are these the sons of the country who will move Morocco forward? that's unreasonable- we're supposed to be Muslims, and Muslims don't behave like this.
I divorced three years ago. I don't have the right to the custody of my children but they live with me. I don't have any source of living. As for the father, he doesn't provide for them. He married one year ago. Please madam consider this topic. I am in a very deplorable situation.
I'm crazy for Fnaire. Thank you.
My comment is that rap is Moroccan 100%.
I greet Fnair group, I'm from Tangier. I congratulate you for your good work.
With all esteem I address my greetings and respects...with my wishes to you of success. Good luck. I'm in Ouarzazate.
Beautiful, God bless you. May God assist you in your projects and represent in the best way the Kabylie woman, God willing.
Raja forever.
Love CAB of Batna.
Long live Farid the Algerian artist.
I love Fnaire and wish them good luck.
God willing there will be good news, may God make everyone recover.
Latif, you're really nice. This is a nice article.
We hope from God to rid us of this malignant disease and we live well and all Moroccans.
I went this disease to be over, enough.
Salam I like Maghreb Arab, because they sing about everything, long live Fnaire ok, long live Morocco.
I love Fnair group, I always listen to this group, there's no comment on this group because it is very nice.
Hi Fnaire, I want you to be a good symbol of Moroccans. I love your songs they're nice I wish you success and wellness every year.
Salaam. How are you Mhde? They are a good group. I hope they continue their career.
There is nothing.
Congratulations to all of you.
May God help the Arab Maghreb! O Arabs, Libya is suffering!
Salamou Alaikoum, I would like to thank Mrs Najat for all her efforts for this foundation and I want to ask her how can I contribute to this association. Salam.
When it is arabized it will be destroyed (when the concern becomes filthy it should be borne by its people). We don't need them from gulf countries kick them out (they are envious). A very proud Moroccan. Long live Morocco +Moroccans and the symbol of the country m6.
nice topic thanks a lot
Hello! I would like to warmly thank Ms. Najat Majid for her great effort that she is making to promote Bayti! Thanks
Hi how are you? I am Salwa from the city of Salé. I like the star programme. I say to Diaa that I like her so much even if she hasn't won. The important thing is to participate. Happy Eid.
Salam. Honestly, since I was young I like Moroccan films and plays to the point that I learn by heart plays and perform them myself like a mad girl. I want to ask you which school I should go to to study acting and theater. If a director has a role for me, hhhh. Thank you. Reply, I am waiting.
I like star academy.
Salam. Thank you very much for this topic. Is it possible to get in touch with this movie star if possible? I think that Rabie gave me the talent of direction and acting. If possible I want to get in touch with Mr Hmido. If possible, he may reply to the msn. Thank you.
May God grant you victory our dear Libya!
Everything will be fine, God willing!
I would like to reply to Hafido. Thank you for your comment! You're free to express your opinion. You say that our king is corrupt. Ok, before I reply to you, I hope you will reply to my question. Then we can discuss. You said that the king is corrupt and didn't show which form of corruption. So the question is clear. Bye!
Congratulations.
I wish I had the opportunity to invent a device that can detect spying signs. But in reality, this can't be realized.
I'm Achraf Diaf from Morocco, my greetings to my mother and father and everyone in Morocco, I will vote for Hajar, I wish her success inchallah. Always RAJA.
I'm Noufel from Morocco, I like Hajar Bhalrti I want you inchallh to be the star with Ahmed, a kiss to all
Leader of Arabs!
These schools encourage girls to engage in debauchery.
I am a university student. I study psychology in Rabat in the school of arts and humanities. I would like to know fields associated with this profession.
Morocco does nothing, just words!
Peace, mercy and blessings of God be upon you. I will go straight to topic which interests me. I am mentally ill and hope someone will help me to find a psychiatrist who deserves this name or any friend specializing in psychology and who is ready to listen to me whole-heartedly and understand my case. Exalted be God! In our country it is very difficult to find a psychologist. I am from the city of Rabat and hope if you know a psychologist to help me reach him. Excuse me for this humble style. I hope you will get my message. If anyone wants to communicate with me seriously, this is my msn. I am waiting impatiently. Salam.
I am a student in the second year at university. The most important thing is an observation I made in my years of education. There is a lack of practical side. This made studies even more difficult because the student cannot understand books clearly unless he examines the patient or listens to the physician talking to him.
Hi! I would like to know if there are any prospects for the subject of psychology. I would like to study it at university.
There is no other god but God, Mohammed is the messenger of God. In the name of God Who is one.
Please, if anyone has the email of Bassma Boussil give it to me. I am waiting for you. Wish you a blessed Ramadan. Thank you.
Hi everyone! I love Saida Fikri so much and all her songs. I respect her a lot and hope you will listen to her. She says words which are 100% true about work and society where we live. My greetings to you! Thank you!
I am Sabrina. I watch star academy every year. Every year I watch very nice Maghreb voices including Diyaa, Asmaa, the princess and queen of the world the most beautiful Bassma Boussil. She has the best voice and she is the most beautiful in the universe, Bassma. For Moroccans and for the world, it is Bassma who took the title because she has taken it but in the last minute, a prince interfered and bought the title for Abdelaziz. Even the academy loves Bassma especially the jury. Love the nice Bassma.
As Muslims, we shouldn't stand inactive and watch from far away. We have to defend our religion and our prophet the best-mannered, peace and blessings of God be upon him, the kindest creature on earth and on this globe.
May God guide you Algerians and Moroccans.
When will candidates of vocational training sit for the entry exam?
Vocational training is a very good project for young people who dropped out of school.
This is one of the features of Morocco. This is a nice idea because of many young people who don't study. I totally agree with this idea.
Hi! My name is Abdelaziz from Taroudant. I am 20. I have studied up to the baccalaureate level. I specialized in aluminium even if it is just a specialty field but I like it. Bye!
Hi! I am Abdellah, I have a lower secondary school certificate. I would like a degree as a mechanic. I am 18.
In Morocco there are no jobs my brother.
Salam. I am Ismail Driss, 25. I have experience in the field of mechanics. I am a professional, but the problem is that I don't have resources to set up a business and settle down. Can anyone help? Thank you!
This is good, Nessma [TV].
Thanks to those who thought of this solution, because what they are doing is a shame. Don't these people on strike have young children? They should understand that they have ruined children. This is a shame and disgrace!
This is the right thing as they have gone too far with their strikes!
I love this team. I have lived in it and I am still playing in it. The best coaches in the club are Charki Abderahim, Abdkrim and Raiss Salak.
At your service messenger of God!
Peace, mercy and blessings of God be upon you. O Lord support our religion of Islam. God is the greatest! God is the greatest! The fate of those who denigrated the messenger, peace and blessings of God be upon him, will be to hell which will be their eternal abode. No matter what they do, Islam will remain above all religions.
This is an insult to the religion of Islam. God is the greatest! God is the greatest! God is the greatest! O Lord support the religion of Islam!
Hi, how are you? You praise God.
I'm new here and I don't have any comment.
I think that this joining is in its place although I don't understand anything in this.
Salam, this site is very nice.
You're all thieves
May God guide its creatures.
Everything is true.
Thank you.
By God, this life is odd!
I don't have a driving license yet and I won't apply for one. I will drive without it so that when they get hold on they will find no way to add or increase points.
I thank everyone who contributed to this online programme. I hope that this cooperation continues between Arabs. I hope that we will make sacrifices for technological science. Thank you.
I swear by God that Islam will win. I swear to you o Jews.
Fear God! Islam is the religion of truth. These people are right. They want the rule of God. God will severely hold accountable every secular. You are fighting Islam. Even if you fight it, by God you won't achieve anything. This is because this religion is solid and God the Almighty protects it. God is the greatest above criminals who don't rule with what God has sent.
I love Nancy so much, I don't know whether she's an angel or what, really. The best to fans of Nancy.
This is unacceptable!
Thank you for this interesting information. It helped me so much in my studies. Viva Morocco!
Morocco will never forget Hicham as he has honoured us.
Congratulations to this young girl! She has encouraged me to go ahead as well and change my subject. At the beginning I was hesitant. As for now, I will change hours. God will help me!
Salam alikum. How are you? I am Soumaya from Agadir. God bless you! I thank you for all your new works! I hope to communicate with you via msn. Is it possible to send me your msn or phone number?
O Lord grant victory to Islam and Muslims in the east and west of earth, o most merciful! Viva Morocco, viva the king!
Salam Rabie. How are you? I hope you will write us via msn. I hope you will reply to my letter. I wish you success.
Salam alikum Rabie. How are you? God bless you! Honestly, your moves are all nice.
Salam alikum. How are you?
Salam. I am Souad from Tawrirt. I am very fond of you Rabie and the way you act especially in the serial "Chajarat Zawya".
I need a man who should support me. My husband is scary, scary and shameless. I have been beaten for three days. I am 23, ten years younger than him. Whenever he sees that I have something new, he is jealous of me not for me. I have no one to talk to. My father died one year ago. By the way, had he been still alive, he would have killed him! By God, we are living in oppression! This is too much! Where are women rights? There is nothing! We are ready to be with you but you should support us both men and women. By the way, not all men are the same. There are some who honor and respect woman. Wake up, enough beating and enough oppression! Imagine that now that I am writing these lines, I have marks of beating everywhere. He poured hot water on me. I am beaten and silent. I feel that I am in a whirlpool. We want some serious action not just chairs where to sit in forums!
Salam. I hope to see you in some religious films because your face is that of a pure Arab Muslim.
Wishing you dignity, from the heart, my brother Rabie! You're my favourite actor, especially in the film "Chajarat Ezzawya". I wish you success and more of the same ahead!
I am one of the candidates to the second session of the baccalaureate. I am scared. They say it is difficult. They organize it so that we won't feel sorry. They know only 1% will pass or less. Is this true or not? Reply to me please.
What I want to say friends is that you should work hard and God will grant success to everyone. God assists the patient. I also have to sit for the second session. I was not expecting this. But things were reverses. This is an opportunity from God. I wish success to everyone.
We want to see Skoma officially in Wydad and Mostafa Bidodan officially.
I have to sit for the second session.
They called it orphan and they weren't wrong. There is no interesting programme except the programme of Soufiane.
Now I say praise be to God but I won't forgive the teacher who was unjust to me in grading. May God take revenge on you. May God forgive you. May God ruin you as you have ruined us. May God take revenge against you. Oh Lord grant us success in the second session, oh Lord.
Present us "Djamai" and "Haj Lakhdar".
The prayer of a witch is not accepted for 40 days; this is banned in religion, my brotehrs!
I witness there is no other God but Allah and I witness that Mohamed is the messenger of God. There is no power and no will but from God. God is sufficient for us, there is no other God but Allah, and He is the best disposer of affairs.
I would like to ask about a few things.
God suffices me and He is the best mandate! These are superstitions, sorcery and polytheism.
Nothing, very mediocre, you don't have.
No to terrorism.
The book of Mohamed Chokri was of great interest for me. Thanks to him, he taught us how to walk on our unkonwn path I even learnt that he died in 2003. Bye.
I want to say that Morocco is good, long live Morocco.
I am from Daaoua, I say that showing women's adornments is totally haram!
The educated ones don't wear revealing clothes. But if they have no parents, this is something different.
Long live Mouloudia, eat your hearts out enemies
By God, I was very happy when they killed Kadhafi. This is wonderful news.
From God we are and to God we shall return. Congratulations for the victory!
We Thank ANAPEC for its services to young people, God is the Helper.
Salam alikum. I am Algerian. I would like to marry an American woman. However, I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do exactly. Please help me! Salam alikum.
I love Tunisia so much!
What kind of questions are asked in order to work in such businesses? They want a university degree in law and informatics.
God is the greatest!
Long live Chnawa, oh brother you're all men. Yes real men.
Hi Chnawa, I hope you're well. I love Mouloudia d'Alger to death. This year the championship inchallah inchallah, make us happy Chinwi.
For me MCA is the best club in the long live Chnawaa inchallah we'll take it this year. MCA is my life.
What they do is unacceptable. Shame on them for depicting the Prophet of Muslims in mean movies. This is haram, haram! By God he is in hell, which is the worst fate! You will find what you deserve.
One can't keep silent about this, deriding the messenger of God, blessings of God be upon him. Arabs must act on changing this saying "Arabs agreed not to agree". You should unite hands in order to defend the religion of Islam which has become a subject of derision for Jews the disbelievers.
These are disbelievers in God, they are enemies of religion. As God said: "And never will the Jews or the Christians approve of you until you follow their religion." Here it is clear that Jews and Christians are enemies of the tolerant religion Islam. We are proud of our religion, which is Islam. God is the greatest! God is the greatest! I witness there is no other god but God and I witness that Mohammed is the messenger of God, peace and blessings of God be upon him.
Viva Kadhafi Moamer the martyr!
There is no power and no will but from God. We will sacrifice our lives for you, o messenger of God! God is the greatest!
Viva Libya and its people!
The best one judo player I saw is Botrik. He has so much to show. He has a sport spirit.
O officials, the rate of 25% of the national exam (bac) is impossible! By God, if only you do a favour and reconsider the issue. If only you would avoid anything that leads to the loss of the coming school year. Salam.
Pardon Mowakil Bari!
Salam. Please I want to know if Fnair reads these messages, please and thanks.
I love rap a little but you made me love rap so much. I love you so much. Bravo Fnair. Go ahead, you have a great opportunity. Bye.

Fnaire forever.
Thank you Fnair for everything you offered us.
My father has worked in the field of fisheries for 30 years. He retired on 6/ 2010. But he receives only 900 dirhams every three months. How can he live with this amount and he has a wife and three children? Can you explain this to me? Thank you!
Salam alikum. My name is Redouan El Mzahem. I would like to know the number of days and calculations. Thank you!
I would like to know the number of points I need for retirement.
I love Bassma.
How is this card? Why don't we get children allowances?
Hi Bassma. You deserve the title of the star. You drive me crazy. My greetings to Brahim.
I want to know whether it is possible to register in the vocational training. I still study in the first year of the baccalaureate. I really hope to apply.
Peace be upon those who guided us, believed in God and His messenger. I want to know the cost of vocational training in order to register in mechanics. I study in the first year of the baccalaureate.
Hi, how are you. I want a solution to the problem of my studies. I left school one year ago. I have studied in the level of the baccalaureate. I want to join a centre. I don't know what to do. Reply to me to go to a centre.
I am a student in the last year of the baccalaureate. I am looking for a job.
I want to learn mechanics profession.
Salam, I am Mostafa. I am 15. I study in the ninth year of the lower secondary. I would like to join vocational training centres. How is that possible and what are necessary conditions?
May God rest your soul, o great martyr Moamer!
I love football to the core!
Hello! I own a project that has been accepted by the Regional Center of the Banque Populaire. Yet the process is taking way too long. I have not even received an approval notice of my proposal in writing. This has been lingering for 3 months now without a result!
I wear the niqab, praise be to God. If you want to know the role of niqab in religion, ask scholars as do the sick people ask doctors. So fear God!
Hhhh, is the party of Benkirane so difficult that 8 parties make an alliance against it? hhh, what a shame!
Now they said that it will work but why does it work and stop, what's wrong with them.
Thank you for the news! May God protect Tunisia from this situation!
God's curse on everyone who contributed to the malicious film. Wake up Arabs!
Yes, it is orphan, poor and starving! If you're not happy with it, just don't watch it. What a DZ mentality! You just like to find fault with anything. Our channel is faultless and respectable.
The Caftan is great and special.
Wow, beautiful! Long live the queen!
There is nothing to the Algerian national team, there's just favouritism.
In my opinion Aamani, you're a jewel artist, I always love you, I always think about your future, the judgment of the last day.
Programs you did this year aren't good. You're laughing at yourselves. By God you're doing nothing. It is just the ad of Amina Rachid which is nice. I address her the best wishes. I like her so much.
Amouna I love you and I love you even more after you were invited to Mousika and Forja show, you're sweet, I've tried to find your number unsuccessfully.
Salam alikoum. For me, I think that the adoption of this law came on its due time, Morocco forever.
Thank you Het Het for your interest in the late Habib Ould Mahfoudh and grant you victory over your enemy.
A greeting to the Mauritanian woman and Maalouma the rebelious
Hi Bassma. I hope you are well. God willing, you will achieve your wishes. You are the nicest voice in the star academy and the nicest Moroccan pet. May God grant you success in your artistic and personal life.
Bassma will always be the best with her strong and great voice. People must encourage such talents or what do you think? From Hind.
Salam Marwan Chamakhe, I'm Safeya from Morocco. I wish you success.
Hi Marwan, Bravo. I congratulate you for everything you did for the national team even you haven't gone to the second round but congratulations. I want to tell you that I love you and will keep loving you to the last day of my life. I know that this is impossible, but there is nothing impossible to God Almighty. I will fight to the last day in my life to meet you although you don't want me but I wish you happiness even if you aren't with me because when you love someone you want his happiness. I love you.
Hi everyone. I'm Soufiane. I live in Morocco. Marwan Chamakh is the best of the Moroccan Cup. He has a combating spirit. I like him so much.
Thank you!
'Salam. I would like to set up a small business. I would like to know the necessary papers.
I am a young man, 24. I have a diploma in industrial maintenance electricity and shoes manufacture. I would like to benefit from Moukawalati programme.
I am a young man, 27. I want to open a workshop for aluminum carpentry. I need a loan through Mouakawalati. I have a diploma in vocational training. I would like to know what to do and where to submit my file. Thank you!
Salam. May God grant success to everyone!
Concerning brothers who want to set up a business and need legal advice in order to set up a business, you're welcome!
Salam. This is legitimate. Every woman must respect herself so that she would be respected and not subject to any attack.
This is a shame and disgrace. You've gone too far!
Salam alikum. This individual who brought this information, I would like to correct a few things for you. I am a street vendor. I sell in Gza. This event which occurred, happened in front of me. There were no Salafis and nothing. These are just young boys of Souika and were working there. They didn't appreciate the situation of that girl. This is because no one would accept the situation of that girl for his sister or daughter. The clothes she was wearing aren't fit for a human being. She was wearing clothes like Tarzan. We must say she was wearing nothing. The young men were offended. I felt the same way. Anyone who accepts that his daughter or sister dresses in this way, I will tell him you're not a man and go to look for a man. One shouldn't exaggerate, there were no Salafis and nothing.
I had an accident and as a result I have a small scar on my face. Is possible to remove it? Are there specialist doctors in removing such small scars. I want the address of a specialized doctor in this field. I'm worried about this surgery, can anyone advise me about that?
I'm Yasmine. I had an operation on a red scar which was on my face. But after the operation, I discovered that it wasn't successful because the traces of the operation and are still there. I want the address of a specialist doctor either abroad or in Morocco. Waiting for your reply. Salaam alaikoum.
I thank the author of this article.
I am a young girl from Morocco. I don't like anyone who attacks other people.
We call upon officials to secure schooling of young girls by providing transport means in rural areas so that they can attend school.
Hi. I am Tarik from Morocco. I wish success to all brothers.
Can I participate?
Peace be upon all of you.
People have suffered too much from this disease! Thanks
I am Meryem from Rabat. I study in the baccalaureate SVT. This year, thank God, I am progressing well in my studies, but I want to study something after the baccalaureate that will be useful in life. I went to the engineering school but they requested a high GPA, 15.68. I only have 14. what should I do, please?
I agree that we must work on raising the awareness of young people addicted to smoking. They should be informed that smoking is hazardous to health. We should produce a TV film on the occasion to fight smoking.
Congrats to Nas El Ghiwane for the success they have achieved especially Larbi Batma, may the Lord have mercy on his soul. Thank you for this great site! I also wish all the best to Bnat AL Ghiwane. Bye Bye!
I am a student in the first year of the baccalaureate. I don't know the right orientation because what I will choose is associated with after the baccalaureate. I want help please. By the way I can choose between two branches literature or humanities.
I want the exam of the baccalaureate literature. I need it so much.
I would like to say that the Nass Al Ghiouane Group is a legendary group and may not be compared to any other group at all levels be it on the level of voice, words and rhythm.
Salam, how can we be Muslims while our mothers and sisters are subject to sexual harassment? Forgive me my brothers if you say these words, from every house there is a woman who goes out without hijab and naked, I don't think there is a man in that house by God. Aren't you jealous for our Morocco like these foreign immigrants?
May God not rest his soul!
They've become rich. They've taken estates, but they don't enjoy that money or anything. They're keen on collecting money. Even when they die and go to the grave, they leave their sons a billion and more.
Kadhafi is the dearest person to me.
I'm Kawtar from Morocco (Casa) I love Hajar she'll be the star inchallah
Long live Mohamed VI, king of the poor!
There is another problem reflecting the problem of the forest. It is the use of wood for heating in some Moroccan villages. The way of getting the good wood is carried out by extracting the tree from its root. It is kept for a long time under the sun. This is the hardest problem. But what is the solution for the people who endure the harsh cold in these remote mountains?
I don't like corruption in Algeria. Rather, enough corruption, enough! We are the Umma of Mohamed. You corrupt people, you the corrupt rubbish will go to hell eternally! Even your skins will be burnt. They will turn into ashes. There is no power and no will but from God the Almighty! I warn you that God does not like corrupt people, the people who kill without feelings, people who don't let these souls live, so they kill them! God suffices me and He is the best mandate against you corrupt people who don't let the soul live! They have no heart. Their life, God willing, will turn into ashes.
First of all, I earn my livelihood from the forest in Sidi Yahya Al Gharb. Peace, mercy and blessings of God be upon you. The forest is really necessary in life in terms of oxygen. But it is also important in daily life, because employs those who work with wood in our country, in handicrafts as well as in firewood to heat public baths, and ovens, coal, also in building sites and barns. Thank you. Your brother Ahmed Haddi 066830161.
Hi! I like Ouarzazate. I want to invite you in the province of Ouarzazate.
Salam, honestly the Sahara is Moroccan and was always Moroccan. And those who say that the Sahara is Moroccan, I am always with them and agree with them.
May God curse you o agent of Zionists! To hell along with your supporters!
Shame on you! I am neutral. "Not a word does he (or she) utter, but there is a watcher by him ready (to record it)." We are an Islamic country. If you want, follow Christianity or disbelief. The introduction to this is secularism. Don't neglect the Book and Sunnah. O Lord o Lord for the decent way of dressing. The body of a girl is all considered private parts. Anyone who denies this should announce that he is not a Muslim then he can do whatever he wants. "And you wait! We (too) are waiting."
Hi, how are you? I'm Sanae from Oujda. Don't leave your country; your country needs you- stay there and defend it. Salam.
We agree with this.
Imitators, long live Morocco.
Salam. I hope this government will keep its promises, make us honour with neighbouring countries and offer us cheap housing not like Abbas El Fassi who has robbed with his friends. They have lived in the government irritating us and distracting us. We want housing no more and no less.
I wish recovery to all the people. I had a friend from Tunis who had the disease and saw how these people suffer. May God heal you! I recommend to everyone who has the disease to eat a spoonful of honey + Nigella sativa as the messenger said, and God willing they will recover!
Hi! I just want the website of inadequate housing.
Hi. Long live CRB. With the will of God we will win the Algerian Cup next year. Long live CRB.
Terrorism doesn't deserve all this debate. It has to be eliminated, Islam is the cleanest, nicest, greatest and noblest thing from God Almighty. Islam is a religion nobler than anything on earth… I call upon you media instead of talking about the killers, talk about the greatness and beauty of Islam, so that all the world may understand it.
Viva Algeria! Congratulations to Algeria, congratulations!
Why does Algeria refuse to solve its problem with Morocco?
God willing we will take the baccalaureate, may God assist us.
Salam alaikoum. I want to know where in Algiers I can study, thank you.
God is the greatest.
May God guide His creatures!
Long live Algeria. Come here Tunsians for your summer holidays.
Salam alikoum. I am Khadija from Jadida I love Diae Taebi to death. I hope that she will find love in her life and be the best graduate of the Star Academy like Amal Al Anbari. Thank you and hope you will accept my words. Thank you.
Hi, how are you? I am from Morocco. I love Hajar Adnane so much. I am sorry for the bad attitude towards her. I hope that this year will be much better than last year. I also hope that there will be a positive change for the students such as their outfits, makeup, etc.
Salam, I am Chara from Morocco. I love Asma = Adnan = Dodo = Saad = love.
Concerning this problem, I think that the closest solution to eliminate it from the source is by raising awareness then by controlling the activity of tourists. Then there should be an intervention in prostitution.
Amniya, you're great. Go on like this so that everyone will love you.
Shame on you to drive away the beautiful Asmaa, by God,this is unacceptable.
I am from France I would like to say to Nessma channel why doesn't it show the stars of the Maghreb ac? Also, where is the tour which they said they would make in the Maghreb?
They can do nothing. We the army will protect you with our souls and blood. We don't fear anyone. They are enemies of God not the righteous salaf.
Salam alikum. I am a Moroccan woman. I would like to marry an Egyptian man. I would like to know difficulties I might encounter in case of divorce or if I want to return to Morocco. Will Egyptian laws apply for me or Moroccan law in case of marriage? Thank you!
Long live Kadhafi!
This is not right. This act is punishable with prison in law.
Is it true there is flu A (H1N1) in Morocco? In which cities?
Today I saw the soap opera "Hia w hia" by Ines Deghidi with Dora. In reality, it was very bad. By God, if she brings girls from Morocco and Tunisia to shoot temptation scenes, Egypt is full of prostitutes. Egyptian actors are eve the ones who have spread pornographic movies and all indecency is from Egypt.
I hope this dangerous pandemic will be fought because it threatens lives of all individuals in society and that vaccination operation will be carried out. Thank you.
Hi, I am Laila from Casablanca 17. I wish success to this magazine from all my heart. I wish it continuity. Thank you.
Salam alikum my brothers. I would like to ask why Moroccans build on arable lands. Praise be to God, the number of people is increasing. What are these people going to eat later on? Why haven't they thought of going to some forests to build good housing units equipped with electricity, water and bridges?
Marouane Chamakh is a great player. I like his way of playing. I wish him success in his life.
Salam.
My friends, I know the country needs such projects. However, but you and those who work with you don't finish work properly. Therefore, from this forum I say to those who rob sons of the country.
Love marwan chmakh
May God grant you happiness!
Antar hey Antar eh Souk Ahrasi!
100% a failing policy.
This law is unfair to marriage.
Cheb Mami is a legend of Rai Music. I love his songs very much. I listen to them since my childhood. I wish to take a photo with him!
That's unfair you want to take the Sahara
here we hope
I love you Farid, even if you have left the Dar, you'll always be a star.
Tripoli is Very Very proud of you...keep going....inchallah the title is for you.
Hajar you're the nicest star, everyone loves you, may God grant you success and be the greatest star, Ouiem, Tunisia.
Hajar is beautiful and a star, Hamid is respectable, Ahmed is the king of the Dar, I ask Hajar to sing for Farah a song, Leila from Safi.
Zaalide, Laayoune. Morocco.
Salam. I wish patience and recovery to cancer patients. This is just a test from God.

Shame
Not normal, this is a great day for Libya! By God, I was happy for them from my heart. God willing, God will help them! God willing they will be an example for Libya. Thank you! Your sister from Mednine exactly from Libya avenue.
Raja forever!
Mohamed Chokri is an example of prominent Moroccan writers. He left and took his heritage. He won't come back into existence. There won't be anyone like him in life again. A great mind was lost!
Soufiane Alloudi is one of the best Moroccan players. Raja forever.
Salam. I'm very happy with this topic, which I came across at random. In reality, this is a really interesting issue that's endured by society in a serious way. Its solution is for authorities to feel the seriousness of the issue and act in the interests of society. Lastly, I, too, wanted to become a psychologist, but what I saw made me change my mind. Sorry for writing in this way! Joya.
Hi Bassma, you're the best in the Star Academy! I want, please, your phone number. I have the words of a single, ok. I am waiting for your reply. This is Oumaima. Well done and keep it up!
Salam. These topics are very interesting, but I notice there are no replies to the presented questions. I also hope to be a psychologist. I would like to know the prospects for psychology after graduation. I hope you will reply. In my opinion, psychology is the best science. I hope it has prospects. Thank you! I hope the administrators will answer questions. OK, thank you! May God help and heal all Muslims!
May God grant you success.
Islam is our religion. God is our Lord. Mohamed is our messenger. We won't allow anyone to denigrate our Lord or our messenger or our religion. We respect their religion. So they also must respect our religion.
I am a graduate of agricultural vocational training. I have been looking for a job for eight years. What can I do? I would like to help my family. I hail from the city of Fes. Thank you very much!
I went to the vocational training centre. They said that I should sit for an entry exam before enrolling.
May God take retaliation
O Lord support our prophet Mohamed, beloved by God! O Lord destroy those who denigrated our prophet! Where are you Arabs? O Muslims, act to support your prophet! O Lord, bear witness, along with the holders of Your throne, Your angels and all Your creatures that You are God Alone without associate and that Mohamed is Your servant and messenger. In the name of God, praise be to God, there is no other god but God, God is the greatest!
Omar, those who did this deserve beating. If I could, I would gather 10 people from every Arab country and I would guard them.
I will sacrifice myself and my soul for you, o messenger of God, I will sacrifice my blood for you, o beloved messenger of God.
Salam. I have a son, 17. He doesn't want to complete his studies. I don't know what to do. Please help me! Thank you!
What are the goals of vocational training?
O Lord this is enormous, o servants of God!
I passed the baccalaureate. Can I apply or not? I hope you will reply young people.
Very nice!
Salam alikum my dear brothers. I am a young man from the city of Safi. I was born in 1993. I have studied up to the last year of the primary education. I just want now to secure a future. I am poor. Sir, they want 14 thousand. We can't afford to pay that. Why are we always like this? Why are all other countries caring of their people except us? When we led a movement of February 20, they beat us. We are always repressed. We are worthless. We are always repressed. I hope opinion of young people will change. Thank you!
Salam alikum. My name is Hodayfa from the region of Nador. I would like to join vocational training. Salam. I want a reply as soon as possible.
Salam alikum. I am a young man from Morocco. I am 20. I would like to join vocational training in the field of hairdressing. I haven't studied at school. I have studied in the mosque. Is it possible to join vocational training with a school certificate? Salam alikum.
To tell the truth, Moroccan girls like foreigners because they are interested in money. But ultimately they face problems and regret it.
Salam. I am a Moroccan young girl. I am 20. I have been engaged for three years. I have married. But now I am about to divorce without cause. He said I am younger than him. We have been engaged for three years. Now I am about to divorce without cause. I am mentally ill. I don't know whether I have any rights now or not.
I am a young man, I have the baccalaureate in experimental sciences. I want to join vocational training which offers employment opportunities for me and for everyone. Thank you! God grants success!
Please provide me the addresses of associations for assistance of single mothers in Morocco. I want the address of an association please. Thank you.
HHHH, you can ask me about soaring pass rate! These are just the statements of the ministry. Moreover, this year there are a lot of people in the bac. May God assist everyone!
I like the sport of Taekwondo.
Gosh, I messed up, I got 2.86 in the regional exam of the 6th. I don't know whether to go on to the bac. Will I pass or will I settle there till they expel me?
I fail in the exam even if I study. I lack concentration. This is a problem I have. I don't know how to address it. I ask anyone who has a solution to get in touch with me. Thank you! Adil, 2 bac life and earth sciences.
This is good. I agree with you in these comments. Your opinions are good. However, comments can be good, but as you say, they should not be disrespectful.
Salam. I would like to know the passing GPA this year.
It is possible that pass rate is high in the baccalaureate. It is ok, the pass rate can be high.
I am Nassima. I am 9. I was born on 01/06/1999. My country is Morocco. I will never let it go. Bye, ok. I ask society to fight corruption because it is a widespread phenomenon.
This old time is better. The other hour has confused us, we sleep late and darkness comes late, offff. Praise be to God! I hope they will never add an hour so that we will be relaxed. The kingdom must take a decision, then citizens. I am sure most of them are exasperated with the situation.
Shame on you Djabri, you have humiliated us!
God is the greatest, God is the greatest! Where is Islam? Where is belief? O Lord guide all Muslims!
Thank you!
I am so happy for all. Happy Eid! Happy new year to all the Arab Umma, Arabs!
May God preserve for us our president, Ben Ali.
The bodies of these are bodies of satans...why this tumult? We want to reverse the American regime, why the regime of the Maghreb?
Machallah, the rule of the Maghreb is going to the dump.
Agadir forever. If Agadir is not there, we are lost. Agadir forever to death and we won't let it down. HUSA.
Nasro is very strong, he is the king of the sentimental, a kind person and very humble. I have wrote him several times in his forum and he sent me a reply. May God protect him, grant him success, protect his parents, Hasni and Fatima. Thank you.
I love you Nasro because you're dear to my friend Tarik.
The nicest place in Agadir is Laazib, Douar Laazib forever to death. El Fatoiki Mohamed
I like Fnair and H-Kayne groups and ask you for sites where I will find these songs. I'm from Saudi Arabia, there are no tapes available here so that I can follow them. So please write their site or where I can find them, thank you.
Rap is the only thing that exists now nearly peace dedication to all brothers may God grant you all pride, magic of rap, long live rap singers of Morocco, we're always with this art to death, good luck brothers.
I would like to join the academy. I am a forward player.
I feel very sorry to hear such terrible events. But even women who have limited mentality, here in such distorted cases, o you dear father, how many men were upset.
Pride to Fnaire.
I want to know when will correction be over.
Honestly, the exam was difficult and regulatory time wasn't enough especially the English subject. I am really scared.
You did again, you ruined me. The exam was difficult. I am not ready to study again.
If you want to know whether you have passed or not, go to the site of the ministry.
Kadhafi is the biggest Zionist!
My story with the baccalaureate. I think that the baccalaureate remains like a dream because those who study don't get it and those who are wandering pass it. In Morocco nothing to do with that and they worsen things with the long programme. How do they want people to pass? By God, they are teasing the sons of the people. Ok, anyway, may God make things easy for everyone.
Honestly, Rabie El Kati is one of the best actors in my opinion. I wish him an artistic career full of success.
God is the greatest!
This is just a trick by mercenaries.
Morocco 100/100.
Come star academy 2. With the will of God there will be new candidates to the level. We long for it. Kisses to everyone.
Hi everyone, you are good.
Salam alikum everyone. I think those people who intended to help us will just stir strife in Arabs and will make us indebted my brothers. No matter what they do, God is above everyone. We shouldn't be scared. Only what God wants will happen.
Hi, by God I thank you as a woman, I liked the topic so much. Thank you for this point of view.
Hi Farid. How are you and what are you up to?
I love Hajar. I want you to show her songs on Nasma channel.
I love you Hajar.
I hope to get a very high score next year God willing. My field of study for the coming year is physics.
I want to say that passing is in the hands of the pupil not the teacher. How do you want people a pupil who doesn't study to pass?
Great programmes but some people don't have land channel Algeria. This is why we couldn't watch "Jamai family". Ok thank you. Blessed Ramadan and happy new year.
I ask my brothers to provide me with the address of the site on which I can find results of 2009.
sons of **** there is still selling and buying in Morocco. I had 9.73, aren't you ashamed?
We love Korean serials please. Programmes in Ramadan were quite good especially "Jamai family", we praise it as well as "Forsan Qur'an", and "Khatam Soulayman" from which we learned a lot. I would like to thank our brothers in Morocco and Algerians who work hard and Moroccan channels especially 2M.
This year I am scared about failing in the exam. I want someone to help me, pray for me and for everyone to pass. Oh Lord grant me success and everyone. I am so scared about failing. I want to pass but I am scared about Arabic because it has broached figures in the social approach but all my friends say it is the romantic approach.
The problem between the brotherly Morocco and Algeria is opening borders.
Salam. How are you everyone? Blessed Ramadan with wishes of good health, wellness and everything you wish with long live especially for the handsome artist Rabie El Kati. I wish you success.
You are mad and ignorant! These people have gone out to protest in order to defend us. Moreover, one thing to the ignorant, go to read about them a little instead of focusing the media which is controlled by America. Just listen to what our scholars say about them o ignorant people!
Power and Always Babia a champion.
Amazigh people should be mobilised now that Kadhafi is dead. Arabs should go away because wherever they go for one hour, they lay foundations in order to break the deceitful Arab enemy. They are not just in Libya, Morocco, all North Africa to the Canaries, they are all the same.
Salam. I thank you for this information about World War II.
Morocco forever, no to terrorism.
I want a file about the contribution of Morocco to World War II.
Regret comes late and you will regret it, o Libyans because only those who don't have bounties feel it. May God rest the soul of the leader of Libya, Africa, Arabs and the world! Living in fire is better than the paradise of Jews!
My comment is that they should find a solution and stop nonsense.
This book is very nice. Peace be upon Mohamed!
Yes, nice topic, great, thank you very much!
The concept of globalization has appeared for the first time in the USA at the beginning of the 1980's. It was associated with economic liberalism, free trade and open markets. This concept was extended after the collapse of the Soviet communist regime in 1989, with the communication revolution since 1990, especially with the emergence of internet. The world has become like a small village. The concept has developed to take technical, political and ideological aspects. This was featured by the intense and rapid transfer of ideas, cultures and values. Life between people has developed.
I have never worked in my life I just want to understand what work is like. Now I have a money problem, I no longer make a living, I need work.
I am a student in the 1st year of the baccalaureate experimental sciences. They gave us orientation papers in order to choose a subject. I don't know what to do. I would like to know available specialties available for me. If you know anything, please help me!
This initiative targets everyone who has an economic spirit, traders and craftsmen not people who have no experience in buying and selling and in the craft. And when they take the money, they do everything they want, and once time comes to pay back, he's powerless. Firstly, these micro-credit institutes should coach these people who are its customers and train them so that they benefit mostly from these loans which they give them. They shouldn't consider them mere customers, because profit isn't in the interest they get from the loan. The objective, as in the reality, isn't profit but to fight poverty and everything associated with the social burden of the people.
This is better than nothing. Anyway, micro-credits are better than nothing. But the problem is that there is some kind of risk in this.
May God guide you, you have ruined us.
I would like to know why Europe which hosts all religions are living in harmony but Muslims who have one religion don't live in harmony with each other. There is strife, war, a lot of killing. Even when Arab rulers agree with each other in Arab summits, why are people unhappy? When Europeans watch you, they laugh at you.
KACM forever. Barça forever. It will take the league, God willing. Crazy boys.
They took 2nd no more, the cup for us this year inchallah, no more talk, and long live USMA, USMA is never down, USMA always 1.
I am Soufiane. I live in Nahda 2 street in Rabat. I am one of the fans of the FAR team.
forza usma annaba
What kind of Jihad in Maghreb? Allah banned killing a Muslim soul.
Hi. I am Asila from Oujda. I wish recovery to all the sick people God willing, oh Lord.
We urge everyone to be patient and persist especially in respecting the feelings of others. This is our religious duty.
I am sick. I have no one in this life and I want you to help me.
My comment is can we treat AIDS?
I think that breast cancer is very serious in our life and that this disease is present in Morocco. I say to all the women in Morocco to fight this disease breast cancer because it is widely-spread. Thank you. Your sister Leila.
Everything is good.
Congratulations Morocco.
I hope you will pass the baccalaureate.
Peace, mercy and blessings of God be upon you. Thank you very much for this site! Honestly, I am looking for guidance and help. I am a 22 year old young girl. I have problems with my father. I don't understand his way of thinking. Honestly, I am tired of him. Sometimes he causes me problems with my mother. I am tired and fed up. Honestly, I want someone to help me. Now I am just sitting home. He prevented me from building my future. I hope to build my future and work in order to get rid of all problems. I hope you will guide me to the right path and offer me advice. Thank you!
Why sons of…. they have an opportunity to succeed and have a job more than sons of the people. What is the passing rate in the first year of the baccalaureate? Anyway, as students, we want the ministry of education to add extra hours in the subject of French especially for students in the city of Tangier.
This is a shame. God suffices us and He is the best disposer of affairs.
O Lord, send your wrath on them and show them severe punishment. There is no other god but God, Mohammed is the messenger of God.
God is sufficient for me and He is the best disposer of affairs. We must preserve our religion and not imitate infidels. Peace and blessings be upon the messenger of God, Mohamed, our beloved prophet.
We hope the ministry of education and teacher will make the baccalaureate exam for this year 2011 accessible for everyone because the level of teachers is unbearable. Most of them don't finish lessons especially lessons in which we will be examined. We ask God to grant success, God willing! Viva king Mohamed 6!
This is an insult to Mohamed, peace and blessings of God be upon him. You are all dogs.
Arabs are always like this and Algeria is a copy of them.
Islam is something nice. So fear God!
I wish you success.
Nothing comes out of what you said, just lies to the sons of Amazigh. The dollars have gone and the sons of Al Hoceima are still living in shanty houses, Morocco doesn't have architects to design earthquake-proof houses, ok enough lies.
We can't find a job even in drilling.
I want to enter this field. Is it possible? Ok.
Great!
I wish success to all Moroccans who study in getting a job.
The problem is the status of the team, God save us. When the athlete is injured, they expel him from the national team. Aouita himself did nothing.
I need to be among hypocrites like my brother Ali. He is the biggest thief on earth. But Said Aouita; where is he? He is the victim of villains; I am sure about what I say. May God curse their religion all.
They have changed his programmes, they have ruined us this year.
It can be said that Karim Tadlawi has special talent to express his feelings for his fans and this made him talented!
Salam Fnair, Sanae from Tetouan, I hope that you will always continue because you are shining in the sky of the Moroccan art. I always hope that you give me your msn with wishes of success.
My opinion about Karim Tadlawi was correct. I think he is the idol of Moroccan artists and is beloved by everyone.
The songs of Fnair are really great. Fnair forever.
I want to encourage Fnair without comment. I love Fnair, a kiss.
I'm very happy because the dearest group is Fnair, for the first time I heard 'Don't touch my country' I liked it so much. I wish to meet them, namely Mohsin so much.
I would like to know the number of days and points at the social security.
Denigrating the messenger is banned. God is sufficient for me and He is the best disposer of affairs. We will sacrifice our souls for you!
Salam. My name is Ismael Ban Mohamed Ban Bastafa. I live in Douar Awlad Bazayar, tribe of Awlad Satout in Zaio, province of Nador. I address you this complaint about the place where I work. I have been working since 65 in SOTRAKAS company. Today I am 69. I am still waiting for my right. Is there any right in this country or nothing?
How many points in my account?
How are you? I would like to know from where I can access the site of the social security fund.
I love so much Bassma, Kaoula, Nazem, Abdaziz and particularly Bassma. God willing she will be the star or Azouz. But they are stars in our hearts. Good luck. Egypt stop this jealousy. We really love Diala because she is Palestinian and her nice attitudes. Thank you.
Salam. I would like to perform in the academy. I play in the middle defense, center forward. I was born in 1997. I live in Smara.
I am Hanane from Tangier. I want to join the vocational training centre to learn fashion design.
Thank you very much for the help and for the valuable guidance! I wish you continuity and success! I want some information about how to start a project with the necessary documents to be compiled. Thank you very much!
Vocational training is a waste of time.
I am a young man who is 20. I am looking for a training in accounting even if I haven't completed the appropriate educational level. I have studied in the eighth grade of the secondary. I ask you to open training opportunities in this level. Thank you.
Youssef Rowabat, I am a talented player. I am 14. I hail from the city of Meknes. I would like to join the academy.
I agree with the efforts of the government about disclosing their assets. Moreover, vehicles of the state shouldn't be used on Saturday and Sunday. Small administrations must respect the right and dignity of the citizen no matter who he is. We call upon the government to allocate salaries for aged citizens in addition to health services. They are militants of Morocco. I thank Abdelilah Benkirane for broaching this topic in parliament. I thank you my brothers in this site. May God protect you abde rrahim al haddad tetouan
Salam, how are you Hajar, you're a star
Hello. I would like to express my sorrow for what happened in Lebanon. We are all Muslims and we are with our Arab brethren and salmu alaykum.
I love you so much Hajar, congratulations on the title, you've made Moroccans proud, you're always beautiful, I love you by God.
Hi, I am Mouhedin from Lebanon. I thank all brother readers for the support of Lebanon even with the word thank you. I hope that Lebanon will be well. But those who have interests in Lebanon don't wish the good for Lebanon. But Syria says that Islam is terrorism but it is quite the opposite. Islam is the religion of love and peace. I defy any country like Lebanon with its sectarian variety. I am from the north of Lebanon but I want to say that Syria says that the north of Lebanon has become a place of terrorism. They want to return by force but they don't know how. May God protect us from the enemies, oh Lord. May God protect Lebanon from strife and sectarian wars, amen my Lord.
I love you so much!!!
I would like to know my account at the CNSS.
I liked Ahlam and her books even if I haven't read a single word of hers this because of the many things I heard about her. I was intrigued by this. I live in France (Bordeaux) and want to read the books of Ahlam because I love literature and adore poetry.
Salam. I am Nadia, Algerian. I like so much Ahlem. She taught me many things in this world. We are waiting for your new works my respectable lady. Goodbye.
Peace and mercy of God be upon you. Amazigh forever. Praise be to God, I am Aziz from Taroudant. I speak Tachlhit.
I love Moroccan movies.
I will sacrifice my soul for you messenger of God.
Thank you for Tamazight, long live Imghran.
The most important is to develop the Moroccan culture.
I hope you will get it.
I like Amazigh songs especially Imghran.
We need Amazigh songs not just to listen to them and dance. We must understand their words because they have nice meanings and tackle important topics which we live in our lives. Chaimae, the granddaughter of Asguin.
Hi, how are you Morocco my greatest greetings to Hajar
Look, this is football. We just have to play, that's all. I am Moroccan and I wish Morocco had won. Anyway, we're brothers, without discrimination. This is sport, that's all. We're Muslims; football shouldn't separate us.
Yes. I think it is better for Morocco to develop and progress, God willing. We want this for our country so that it will become one of the developed countries.
Thank you for the information but I hope to have more. Thank you.
I love Amani Souisi because she is pretty and talented. I also love Amal Lanbary because she is also talented and pretty!
May God grant you happiness, Antar Yahya! We wish you a nice life, God willing! As you have brought us joy, God will make you happy! Thank you!
God, the homeland and the king.
Why do you want to liberate the Arab Maghreb when it is free. Go liberate Gaza if you can!
Excellent!
It's a shame, one talks to people who don't know that the messenger used to cry when he heard the voice of the Imam Al Hussein, so do you expect that you know what's Achoura. Celebrate and rejoice, people are rejoicing in their lives and afterlife. Woe to you from God and His messenger, Our lady Fatima El Zahraa who is the daughter of the messenger of God and mother of El Hussein. Remember that.
Salam. I want to join Star Academy.
They celebrate with joy, there are some reasonable people who understand the meaning of this day and the calamity of the death of the greatest martyr. Not all Moroccans are Sunnis, by God.
I love you Bassma. I prefer you to famous singers. I wish quick recovery to your mother.
Bassma is the nicest star!
Long live Mouloudia. Always with you, Samira from downtown Algiers.
I miss you so much!
Long live Algeria! It is in my heart. God willing, it will progress and become like European countries.
Salam. Long live Algeria and Bahara. A greeting to Kartakhina and France in particular.
Salam. Viva Bahara! Harraga to France, Algeria, long live the boat!
Long live all residents of Bahara. Long live the national team. Go overcome them both.
Salam alikum. Please I need the phone number or address. Thank you!
Salam alikum. I would like to undergo a hand plastic surgery.
Very impressive.
Kac forever forever whether winner or loser, we are only concerned about the fans, history and stars who wrote their names in history. I wish them success. Long live KAC
I agree with the Tunisian people.
I want to remove fat. I want the phone number of a surgeon in Tangier. Thank you!
Benbouzid, stay away from this problem. You don't know sons of your country, dog but we love you.
I have the diploma of nurse. I have studied for two years. I have looked for a job in the private sector but found nothing. There are no jobs!
I want summaries of all the lessons of the baccalaureate.
I want the number of students, schools and teachers in Morocco. Is it possible.
I have a problem with black spots on my face. Is there a solution?
I am for justice. Terrorism harms innocents- instead of blowing up oppressors, they blow up innocents.
Thank you
I want a surgery to remove the scars of childbirth.
Salam to everyone who is Settati, Mezbi or from Chaouia and Ouardigha, what have you done to you? We are immigrants. Our fathers worked for the Maghreb, then you took our resources and took our father. He died in France. You closed borders in his face. Your father killed Lekhribgi. Needless to say the name. And you are still going on in this. We know everything about you. Sahara is not Moroccan. Give to Sousse people their land. We want Chaouia Ouardigha to become a republic not a monarchy. 38 millions you take would be better spent in the country, you who don't have relatives in ...Italy.
I have a baccalaureate diploma. I want to study accounting but don't know what to do. I have passed the entry exam in secretary studies. Now that I have the baccalaureate is is better for me to keep this field or what else should I do???
You see, you're just liars, you're teasing the people. Shame on you, take some interest in us, you've made us hungry.
Salam in the presence of our Imam. I want to know who is the author of the article on 13/11/2007 because he has the same name as me. As to your site, I like it. God is the helper; thank you.
Honestly, I tell you that diplomas are now being granted not to the people who deserve them. They have become mere papers taken by the people. And even if you take that diploma but you don't deserve it because it is based only on cheating. But unfortunately, officials don't make a stiff control to avoid cheating cases. Thank you.
Salam alikum. May God grant you long life our sheikh Ezzahi, Ezzahi, Ezzahi. May God, God willing, heal you.
Salam alikum our great sheikh. May God grant you long life. You're great. I tell you a 1000 and 1 times that I love you to madness. Thank you for your efforts Mr Ammar Ezzahi. May God brighten your life as you have brightened lives of people. Bye.
Hi sheikh. May God protect you from the eye and words of the envious and die with the deceased.
May God rest the soul of Kadhafi!
Kadhafi died in a hideous way. He doesn't deserve this because he wanted to make a currency stronger than American dollar made up of gold but America stood in his face and spread many lies saying impossible things about him. This is how Libyan rebels emerged against him until he was killed by traitor rebels of his country. Of all this we say Moamer Kadhafi is a martyr and his fate is to paradise, God willing!
Long live Bouteflika. Long live Mohammed Al-Malik. Long live Algeria. Long live Morocco. Long live Tlemcen. Long live Rabat. May God assist you President Bouteflika. May God assist you king of Morocco. Long live the Islamic Maghreb.
Thank you, my sister. You're really very intelligent. Thank you, my sister. I thank you so much.
Hajar is a star in the hearts of everyone but when will the album be released.
I think that Hajar had an opportunity but she didn't seize it just by greed. I hate her particularly because she was in a relationship with Ahmed and when she took the title she turned against him. I hate her.
Hi Hajar, you have honoured Morocco with your work, but where are you? We haven't seen any video clips. This is not a problem, I wish you happiness in your artistic and personal life and success with the will of God.
God bless you Hajar. I wish you success.
I am Manal from Morocco. I want to say to Asmaa: do you love Adnane?
Yes, everyone has the right to say whatever he wants. As an Amazigh man, I am proud of my identity. I am also proud to be a Muslim. However, Tamazight will remain my mother tongue. I will defend it to the last day in my life. Greetings. Thank you.
Thank you very much.
I love you Nancy ...
Even if they assigned one teacher for every student at the same table, even if they tear apart all papers and everything, they would still cheat. This strife exists. No one can eliminate it, because they are robbing from now. When they will grow up and work in a senior function, they will have a diploma.
1, 2, 3 viva Algeria!
Peace of God be upon you. I am a teacher and every year I ask for information about completing my studies through the internet. But always I get nothing at all.
Yes yes Morocco forver. I'm a pure son of Casa. Even if I live in France, Morocco forever and Wydad the red forever, Boka junior and yes yes yes inchallah the CAN is for us Moroccans.
Salam, how are you. I welcome this program.
I'm Nora from Casa, Rachid Wali is the best actor for the Moroccan TV. I wish you a successful career in this field.
Salam Rachi. Rachid I like all your nice films and admire you even more even if I live in France I follow all your films and series 'Al Mostadafone' which was very great. My warmest greetings.
Salam, honestly I am a young girl, I'm 25. I have a problem and honestly I hope that you would find me a solution. I was acting in the theatre of Casa, I did a play "LI DARHA BIDIH YFOKHA BISNIH" (If you commit it with your hands, solve it with your teeth). But I have a great hope and more ambitions to be like Rachid Lwali and more. Honestly I hope that you help me ok. I am going to give you my number I live in Beni Mellal.
This is what the government of Benkirane has reaped for its people.
By God when will results be announced. I am tired. I am getting mad. I am her friend. I am in a worse condition. Ouf.
It is normal that a girl walks out on the street wearing a mini-skirt. However, in this country, there are repressed. That's all. When they see a girl wearing a mini-skirt, they get mad!
No individual can assault any individual.
Never mind dear, be patient.
Please I want to know electrical engineering, may God reward you with good.
Salam. I study in the first year of the baccalaureate economic sciences and management. I want you to tell me whether this branch has a good future so that if I am wrong in my choice I will change it. My score is 14.
Salam Mr Chamakh I'm Mohmed from Warzazate try as much as you can so that we win the cup
They say the government!
Shame on you! You killed your leader. The dear one is dead, it is over.
Peace and mercy of God be upon you. I work in a beauty salon. I don't have any papers showing that I work. I am 23. I would like to get a loan to buy an economic house and I would like to know what necessary papers are needed. Thank you! I hope the reply will be clear.
I am a worker. I would like to benefit from Fogarim. I want some information, thank you!
Hi I want please a topic about the contribution of Morocco in World War 2.
I want a halal loan.
Thank you very much!
Now you know that even if I am from the Maghreb and everything it has, I only defend my country Morocco.
By God this is the lie of this era! My brothers and sisters, no and a thousand no, there is no Islamic bank in Morocco. There are banks alleging they deal in Islamic products. But this is mere fancy and lies! God knows better, peace and prayer be upon our messenger Mohamed.
Salutations to men who love their country and freedom!
I want to work O subjects of God! I am tired of joblessness!
I am a young girl, 26. I am married to a French man. I currently live in France. I have many problems in my marital life. I can't find a job. I need help.
I wish you success. May God reward you with all the good!
How brazen you are brothers! You are manipulating people. But you don't offer jobs to anyone. May God guide you! This is enough! You're just exploiting each other. Honestly, Morocco needs some other people. Please publish this!
I am a lost young girl. I am looking for a job of any kind. I ask for your help, please help me, save me because my mother beats me everyday and says I am the shame of girls!
Salam alikum. I hope you will help me in looking for a job in a company. Thank you!
I am looking for a job.
I am looking for a job in any kind.
I want you to define Moroccan telecommunications, thank you.
Hi Nader, how are you? Are you ok, I want you to be strong and work hard. I wish you success. Sing a song you like for me… Bye.
Long lives Mohamed VI May the Lord protect him for our Islamic and Arab nation and long lives the Moroccan army and high is the banner of Islam!
Honestly, Maroc Telecom is the best in Morocco and I always prefer it's the best, better than Meditel.
I am waiting for Star Academy. I liked it so much by God. May God grant you success with the will of God. You are the best in terms of Arabs.
Salam.
I am a young man from Morocco. I would like to have news about the stars of Star Academy Maghreb 1. Thank you.
Hi Oumnia, I'm Ahmed, I write song words, if you don't mind. Thank you our artist.
Hi, this is great. AIDS, God forbid.
Relations between Arab countries should be developed by facilitating import and export. This will help young entrepreneurs.
Shame on Libya! However, Kadhafi deserves this!
May God rest his soul, he is a martyr!
Salam. I love Rachid El Ouali and I like his films.
Hi. I am a Moroccan man from Spain. I love acting and love all Moroccan actors. But I like some of them most on top of them Rachid El Ouali, Saad Tsouli, Fatima Khir, Benissa Souad, Sabir Ahanan, Ali Blahimi, Sana Akroud, Soumaya Akriou and others. But Rachid El Ouali, Hanan Librahimi so much.
Salam. O Lord grant victory to the son of Kadhafi, o Lord!
Hi! I like Antar but he doesn't play like before. Anyway, we always say praise be to God! 1, 2, 3 viva Algeria!
There must be a resolution to the problem of illegal immigration
Salam alikum. Are loans from FOGARIM haram?
Hajar is nice 2
Mami is the top of Rai and I wish he stays so!
Ok! Cheb Mami you are unique! for the second time you beat the competitors in being the best Arab voice of the Maghreb whether they like it or not. For me Mami is the house of rai!
How are you Hajar, I'm Ali Joughou from Agadir, I'm 16, my greetings to Hamid, Ahmed And Farah and even Hamid.
Salam, Hassan, how are you Ahmed, Hamid, Hajar, Farah
Mister such and such, son of such and such, friends of such an such,daughter of such and such, all sailing through with the help of connections and vote their hands high for the potato at AD 120.
To hell, God willing! For those who mourn Kadhafi, none have seen the torture endured by the Libyan people for 42 years. They are mourning for their good, not Libya, to hell, he destroyed the country and the people, I hope they will execute Seif, Saidi and Hannibal.
In spite of everything, Moamer Kadhafi will remain Arab and Muslim; therefore, Muslims shouldn't give this hideous image to the west. So congratulations to anyone who disfigured the image of Muslims!!
Shame
Shame on you! There is no power and no will but from God!
I love H-Kayne, Meknessi OK!. I love khalid Hatim. Long live H-Kayne
Salam. Honestly, you haven't given us all our rights. You see students playing all year around and in the end they pass. But we look at the sky. Moreover, since you don't fear anything, why don't you give us our scores? This is what I want to understand.
I think the most difficult exams on earth are in Morocco! Make them a little easy, this is too much!
Hi Bassma! I am Khadija from Kénitra. I am crazy for you. I like you so much. Take care! I wish to have your phone number, ok, bye!
I am one of your most fervent fans. I love you so much and tried to reach you but I can't. May God grant you success in your career. I miss you so much. I hope to reach you as soon as possible. I hope you are with the man who loves you, I mean Yahya. May God protect you world beauty queen! I die for you!
We can't keep quiet about this. Mohamed, the messenger of God, is the greatest man in the universe.
Bassma, you're very beautiful, God bless you. Everything in you is beautiful. You have a beautiful voice and everything is nice. May God protect you Miss Morocco!
Salam Bassma. You're very beautiful. Your voice is great. We miss you so much. We hope to see you in a new album. I hope you will produce a song.
I love you Bassma you're really great!
Salam alikum. My name is Mohamed. I am 18. I would like to participate in vocational training. I want to study mechanics. Thank you!
I would like to learn aluminum craft.
My name is Mohamed Zaoui. I study Tronc Commun Sciences. I would like to continue my studies in vocational training. I am 18. I need some information about this branch and type of subjects.
Salam alikum. Please, I want to do vocational training. I need someone to help me and tell me something good with a good diploma. Thank you!
As a young man, I ask you to benefit from football. Thank you!
My name is Hassan. I am 15. I study in the lower secondary. I would like to study vocational training. Is there any reply? Thank you!
My opinion is like other people.
Salam, I thank Nessma TV, I thank Hajar, Badro, Ahmed, Hamid, Jamal, Soraya
I am a Moroccan woman. I would like to marry an Egyptian man and marry in Morocco. How long will it take us in Morocco to collect marriage paper? Please help me! Please help me!
This site is fantastic.
I want to join the school of aeronautics but I don't know anything about it, the admission procedure and where it is. I study in the first year at university.
I wish success to women football in Zagora. All my respects to all players.
What the Arab Umma has reached in recent years is evidence about its weakness and impotence in the face of all the enemies of the Umma.
Salam. I think that sport is good. I wish, God willing, success to every beginning women's team. I shouldn't forget the team of Boghaz Tangier. It's a nice team. We thank managers who made sacrifices with us. The players are distinguished; their performance is good, as is that of the captain of the team. I play in Barcelona but my country is always in my blood. Wishing you success!
Morocco my dear country was always a country of tolerance. Bravo my country. Morocco + Algeria + Tunisia the top of the world.
A very nice topic and thanks to the site for the news.
May God rest the souls of martyrs! Algerian people won't forgive tyrants in this life and the afterlife!
Olfa is a person very intellectual and learned in religion. I am one of the people and I tell her well-done for the work she does. But she should not state religious sayings or say this person said or the other said. We must fight this phenomenon like Amr Khaled. You feel that he uses religion. This is not a personal attitude. There are many people who share this opinion. Well-done Olfa. Well-done, may God assist you. I say to those who wrote before me please don't offend the dignities of people. To the Gulf people who accused Olfa of infidelity, let them look at themselves what they are doing. Thank you.
I am struggling with finding a job. I have a diploma. What can I do with it? Hang it at home? Why have I earned it? I go daily to Anapec in Maamoora. Advertise something which will help us work! Anapec of Tangier is nothing. This Anapec is full of unemployed people who come and go. There is nothing. My mother asks me everyday if I have found a job. No one likes me any more at home or in the neighbourhood. What should I do? It is better that I hang myself!
I think that this initiative is very interesting for young people because it's very important in this era.
In my opinion the association daba 2007 has come to encourage young people namely to participate in elections and this cannot be achieved by this association or any other association after it why because young people need today jobs and not associations and this cannot be achieved in the absence of a real will to achieve this goal
We thank you so much for this initiative which we have been expecting for a long time, I wish you all the success in the future, I'm quite sure that you're on a steady and right path towards success
Morocco forever, Zaki forever, enough with foreign robbers who have exhausted the budget of Morocco.
Long live Morocco whether it is Zaki or someone else. We hope it is Zaki.
Zaki, Zaki, honestly, he is the adequate coach for the national team. I want to know what his problem with the federation is.
I love the coach Bado Zaki.
Zaki is the best coach necessary for the national team as well as some players like Sektioui, Alloudi, Zairi, Taarabt, Mokhtari and Jermouni.
If they want to do something, they should bring a coach from the amateurs league. It would be better. This is my opinion because the federation doesn't want to understand. We are always changing coaches. May be they want to reach a cup on the moon.
Morocco doesn't know what it's doing. They come to take money instead of bringing Badou Zaki and boys from the national league.
I am a fan of Zaki. I say it proudly, he is a real coach for his achievements. Not anyone can just come and say I am a coach as some do. They don't even have a diploma. Some of them have a diploma of hairdresser and enter as coaches. The federation knows this. I say it with pride.
I don't like any coach except Badou Zaki. Long live Mouloudia d'Oujda. Long live Houssin Kousmous. The head of Fakhir is like a donut, his eyes are popped up and he becomes a coach. He should take a donut and put it. Fakhir out, Fakhir out. Long live Badou Zaki and a greeting to Mouloudia. Abdelkader Ouazzani from Oujda.
Football in Morocco. We need a Moroccan coach so that he defends the national team. Everyone has to be changed, all.. Zaki. Zaki. Without Zaki, there's nothing.
Salam. My name is Adil. Rabie Kati, you're the best actor for me, especially in the film "Chajarate Zawya".
I am Radwane from Morocco. I am a player. I would like to play with Real Madrid school. I hope you will accept this offer. Wish you success!
Hi Rabie! I am Najoua. I love your job. I hope to be like you some day. I like the way you act. I like it. I hope to see you some day face to face. I wish you a successful career and nice life. I live in Ouazzane if you want to know. I like you so much and take care. I loooooooooooooooooove you.
God bless Rabie Kati!
Khairi I love you so much and hope that you'll attend the tour, you're the best star, you shouldn't have left so that you'd be the star. Hind from Morocco.
We haven't seen anything yet.
This is nice even if I didn't read it. Poor Fatna is dead. This is sad.
Lakhdar Maghnaoi, 67. I am Amine from the city of Maghnia I greet you.
Hi! Excuse me, I want to reply to that lkidar who said she will find her songs in the afterlife. He forgot she is just an artist. In his house there are things you know, and he is criticizing the best artist in our country. May God have mercy on her and on us. She is our legend. From God we are and to God we shall return. My greetings.
Congratulations Nader. You deserve the star. I hope that you will get the title of the world star, God willing. Jihane from Morocco.
By God Nader deserves more than the star. I love him so much.
If you study, you will pass. Forget doubts Moroccans.
My name is Hamouda. I wish you better health and quick recovery God Willing!
Nice place! Can you please post here rules for long jump?
Hey everybody- Raja til death!
We want them to take care of the sons of our people including young people of the south.
I see that everyone wants a loan. However, no one has received a reply to his questions, so why do others ask the same questions?
This is good so that they will institute private courses which will help them in the exams. I also take courses at 1025 dinars.
Salam alikum. May God reward you with all the good, I want a summary lesson of the Russian Revolution. Thank you!
Thanks to the site!
Even if it is not complete, thank you for the research!
This is nice. Honestly, it warms the heart. We hope we will keep being in touch and exchange information so that knowledge will spread. Thank you very much!
I want research tackling the contribution of Morocco in World War II. I mean the military and economic contribution in addition to the outcome of this contribution. Thank you!
The concept of globalization appeared for the first time in the United States at the beginning of the eighties in the last century. It was associated with economic mechanism, free trade and opening markets. Then the concept extended after the collapse of the Soviet socialist regime in 1989 with the communication revolution in 1990 especially with the emergence of the internet. The internet has become like a small village. The concept has developed to include technical, political and ideological dimensions. It means it has moved from the tabloid to the ideas, culture, values and people have progressed.
I want to work and you are lying to us.
I am not married but how? There is a higher number of girls; a higher rate. I have a problem. I am 24.
If only things were not mere ink on the paper and were carried out in reality. I am a single young girl. I am 25. I don't see any objection to presenting the issue. This is the rule of the Lord of Lords. Why has it not entered into effect? This should be implemented because I have asked a lawyer and he told me the issue is presented but it hasn't entered into effect.
Hi. I am looking for a job in the company La Vache Qui Rit.
I am a married woman. I have a baby, eight months. My husband went to court to divorce me. The hearing will be in 10/2009 because he wants to marry a woman in France in order to get papers to live there. I want to know what to do. Thank you.
Thank you for the interest shown to the Moroccan woman, which has raised her standing in society.
Salam alikum. I want to thank you for this great site and for the explanations you present to solve problems.
I am Hanane from Agadir. I have children and was victim of violence for nine years. But today I managed to overcome fear and went to my family's home. Now I have gone to court to get divorce. I want to know if the judge will grant me justice knowing that I have presented medical certificates. Thank you for your consideration.
Miserable Rached Ghannouchi, all this fuss in the country this year!
I don't know why the unemployment rate is on the rise annually. I dream and pray to God that it will decrease. We study a lot and we sit without job, girls do housework and boys unemployed. What can we do. I hope that this problem be solved as soon as possible.
I have nothing to say- unemployment has increased in Morocco... what should we do?
That is unacceptable by God, I am a person from Morocco and I have my family in Constantine.
America wants a weak Arab Maghreb so that it will take its interests with the lowest price. Phosphate from Morocco, oil from Algeria, the strategic position of the Straits of Gibraltar and Souisse. Thank you Magharebia!!!!
I agree with this article.
We are proud of our great Morocco, which gives a multi-dimensional look of great importance for present generations. I want to say through this message: Take care of our community living abroad. Thank you.
I am looking forward to this Amazigh channel. I am waiting for it impatiently. I hope it won't be long. Finally, I hope to thank everyone who makes an effort to make this channel see the light.
Thank you for this channel!
I am very happy but we want to know its name, its frequency and its position. Thank you.
Salam alikum everyone. You, my brother Rabia, are a great artist. You are also nice both in your beauty and manners. I die for you as artist. I wish you success in your career and long life. I shouldn't forget to tell you that you are loved by all Moroccans who live abroad. Concerning those who say you don't deserve to be praised, they are the one who don't deserve to contribute to comments. We need to support our artists by encouraging them as do other Arab countries do. Excuse me if I was long. May God protect you brother Rabia from the bad eye and evil of enviers!
I wish recovery to all Muslim patients!
Salam alaikoum. We Moroccans wish to have an Islamic bank, this will help us a lot.
On behalf of our dear people, we hope to have our own Islamic bank, as our religion is the best religion and you have all consideration in the issue.
There is no god but Allah, Mohamed is the messenger of God.
Kadhafi is a skilled man. He didn't oppress anyone. In his country, there are no bars no wine, and no nightclubs for spending the night and debauchery. Libyans have become satiated and conceited.
Do you think that you'll beat us, Chnaoua? Hahaha...
Inchallah the Mouloudia will take the final, long live Mouloudia and good luck to Mouloudia.

This disease is like any other disease. It can be the cause of death or a test from God. No one dies with less age. The person or patient should be strong and have a strong belief. Work for your life as if you will live eternally and work for your afterlife as if you will die tomorrow. (A believer is tested). I have lost my dearest people as a result of this disease. Despite this, I am not worried about being afflicted with this disease, because my belief in God is strong.
My mother has cancer and can no longer stand up. The doctor told us there is no hope even with the treatment. She had cancer only in the breast from the past 6 months. I wish recovery to everyone who has this disease, oh Lord hasten the recovery. Thank you very much.
Salam aloikum. I wish recovery to everyone. I have a cousin who has leukemia. I wish him recovery from God and to everyone. Now he is in Casablanca. But he has not yet been admitted to hospital. He has not found a vacant bed. He is a member of Lala Salma association. He is orphan. I hope if anyone knows an association or someone who offers help to guide us to him, may God reward you. I am 24. When he learned he has the disease, he was shocked. He is scared. He has no one to help him. I wish recovery to everyone. You know that the fees are very high.
I suspect that I have breast cancer. But I don't have resources for treatment, I don't know what to do or how to act.
Ha! What is this absurdity? Love via the internet! You find illegitimate love. This love isn't complete. Real love comes randomly. Random love is better better than seeking it via the internet.
What is this shame? This national team has become (unclear) especially recently. This is too much. Since 2004 we haven't understood. Everyone steals. I have never seen the team with four coaches except now. Everyone wants to take his share so that the president of the federation will be living in abundance. This is too much. If they don't want Zaki, who do they want. They want someone to steal with them. Let them bring a coach and sign with him a deal over 3 years. When he completes six months, they fire him in order to steal again. Those who still go to watch the national team have very big ears.
Please a topic about drought.
May God heal the king Mohamed VI of Morocco.
I was happy.
For me, Rabia El Kati is the best actor in the world.
Salam. I am Fatima Zahra from Taza. I live in the same neighbourhood where you were born. It is Al Quds. Honestly, I admire you artistically. This means in terms of acting. I wish you a successful career God willing. Bye!
What are the problems of Morocco in swine flu? What are decisions adopted about this fatal disease? Are there medicines against this serious disease which threatens our dear country Morocco? I want sincere replies.
INDH is a precise step towards development, but things have to be taken seriously. God grants success!
Rap forever pride to flow ros sage but the rubbish of Fnair, h kayne or bigg, nothing to do of that. I'm from bm city
Hi everyone. I thank all the friends who encourage Fnair and others, the new ones here. I want to say that we are here to encourage them and not discourage them so please a little respect. Thank you.
Hi. I know sister Bochra that Fnaire's songs are nice but this doesn't prevent me from saying that Mohsin is the best of them and I will make my place inchallah. And if you like them all, I just like him. Thank you anyway and your welcome. Sister Bouchra.
What is the number?
I would like to know if my account goes to my social security card.
I would like to learn about the social security fund.
Hi. I would like to ask you about the site of bac results 2009. Thank you very much. Good luck to students.
In the name of God the most gracious the most merciful. I am pleased to play football to become like Chakir Abdrahim.
I am a talented player. I play football well, I play with the left foot.
Algeria is the country of men. Bouteflika is the master of man and we will increase his mandate. A thousand greetings to Algeria and our dear father, Bouteflika!
This is good. This is a very excellent article.
Sallam.
Salam. I am looking for a job. May God reward you with good!
I am a Moroccan woman. I am sure that the Algerian people don't accept that Algeria supports Kadhafi against rebels no matter what happens. As for generals, only God knows because they are friends and they have concocted this together. However, the people will certainly not accept. Don't forget a million and half a million who died for dignity and pride!
The issue is exaggerated and requires an investigation. We hope that Mr Darif Tahari tells us the truth and investigates the information.
Salam alikum. I am looking for a job in aluminum carpentry. I am an assemblage and cutting worker. I want a job. May God reward you with good!
I want more information.
I say Algeria can easily defeat Morocco!
Ahlam is an extraordinary writer.
Salam alikum. I am looking for a job as painter or any acceptable job. Thank you very much! **Phone number removed by editor**
There is a lot of talk but no action. You always say this. But when it comes to work, only sons of influential families work. We know pretty well this story. It has become a disease. This is how we Tunisians are, we say lies.
This is not reasonable! The son guides the father, this is not part of our traditions or any country except in Tunisia. I hope from my heart we won't have such a law. I am 19 and I don't appreciate this condition.
Oh, your plant is great but it pollutes the environment.
There is no federation and nothing. There are just thieves. The problem isn't with the coach; the problem is with the federation.
Lemerre bring them all change the names of players. Ok bye. Give me your msns.
I am a young man. I would like to start a poultry project. I need some information about it.
My Bassma, it is you who should win.
Congratulations! Wishing you good descendants! Wishing the same to me and my cousin! OK, I like Hallich and my cousin likes Antar Yahya.
Many congratulations! You deserve each other!
The Saudi shoudn't have won because Basma and Meshoo were far better than him.
Bassma a star no matter what happens. Even if she didn't take the title, she is a star in our eyes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
All these frictions with Al Qaeda are a source of security for European countries.
Exalted be God! Tunisia has its Sahara. Algeria has its Sahara. Libya, Egypt, Mauritania, and why not Morocco, o enviers!
We love Bahara beach and long live Warda.
A greeting to sons of Namar and sons of Sidi Lakhdar and especially to me.
Love you so much and die for you.
Long live Wlad Namar, long live Mostafa my brother and my friend Malyar.
I love you Bahara and die for you my country.
Long live Algeria and the town of Bahara illegal immigrants.
Salam alikum. I entered this site by chance and I liked this. I have one problem. I have spots on my face. I ask you anyone who knows any plastic surgeon in Rabat to give me his address. Thank you!
I would like to do a plastic surgery to my hand. What is the cost of the surgery?
Salam alilkum. I would like to ask you about the cream for breast enlargement, is it harmful for the breast or not? Please help me!
Salam. May God protect you, I want to do a plastic surgery to my nose. If possible, I want your phone number.
I would like to participate in English studies.
Eh Ben Bouzid go. Your daughter goes to study in England and we are studying a programme you have imported. Go away or die! okkkk.
Look, by God this is not good. This is a new programme. They hurt us. One could hardly do anything with the old programme and they brought us a new one.
Go Almighty guide those he want. Praise be to God and congratulations the pilgrimage Amina, may God accept from your and forgive you. God is Almighty.
Good, she deserves more for going out naked!
Salam. My name is Abdelmajid from Rabat. When I dropped out of school from the baccalaureate level. I studied in the training centre in painting and decoration. Now I would like to set up a business in this field, so what are the necessary papers?
Salam. Wishing success to everyone!
Peace of God be upon you! I am Sofia from the city of Larache. I would like to know how loans are granted to small businesses.
I am a young man, 29. I would like to set up a business in wood carpentry, aluminum, glass and iron. Thank you!
Salam alikum. OK, my name is Boukil Adil. I am 25, a student in Omar Ben Omar in Hotel Catering and Tourism, Oujda. I think that Moukawlati is a good idea for all Moroccans. In order to ensure the success of this office, a working strategy of this office has to be drafted. They have to settle in areas where there are OFPPT centres, for example, and introduce entry exams for businesses. In this way, Moukawalati can pick up projects.
I love you so much Bilal. The music of Bilal is very entertaining my brother. Bilal forever.
Othmano from Algiers. I love Bilal so much. I have all his albums. You are successful Bilal…
I am Nabil from Casa. I am a fan of Bilal. He is my dear friend. We are always together. I hope to meet him. I hope that he performs in Sbata.
I want to undergo a surgery for my nose because it was broken when I was young and it is curved and has become bigger. Is there a solution? I am in Casa, please reply to me.
The problem is the problem of government and rulers corruption. The problem doesn't lie in the people, we (Moroccans) bear no hatred to the Algerian people. But if only, if only the rulers were to follow the example of the people. But if the people want to live one day, destiny will certainly respond.
Hi. Firstly, I thank you for this website. I am a Moroccan man from Rabat. My name is Bilal and I love cheb Bilal so much and his songs. I want to tell him "Cheb Bilal, may God bless you and protect you for us" because Bilal is my mind. Bilal forever. I love those who love Bilal and curse those who hate him. Thank you very much.
Hi, I am Idoub. I love so much Cheb Bilal. I also love all my friends Hamid, Tahar, Oukba, Sif, Ousama, Yousef and all the people.
Salam the nicest eyes. My son Yassine who is 2.5 years old loves you. He doesn't move from the TV until the clip is over. Then it is the song 'Shakhbat Lakhabit Alhit, Wana Kaman'. Tarik from France.
By God we have returned to the starting point, this is Algerian the other is Moroccan and the other Sahrawi. May God curse this situation we have reached. There is no power and no will but from God. Governments benefit and the people are boiling haha. Are we Muslims or cattle herds?
In the name of God the most gracious the most merciful. If we examine the issue of the Sahara historically, we will find it has been Moroccan for centuries. Colonization left it without borders in order to leave conflicts between the two countries. As to Algeria, its intention is not to institute peace between what they call Polisario. It is seeking to reach the Atlantic Ocean and extend its territories. Algeria is ruled by generals, it is not ruled by Bouteflika.
Salam alikum. I'm Fatiha from Boujdour. I would like to have information about social security. Please inform me!
This is a great topic, very nice! Thanks to those who worked on it!
Why there is no interest in artisans in terms of wages of artisans? Their wages are limited. This is a problem for us. Salam. I am Otman from Tatouan. This is a very interesting article.
Salam. I am Khaled from Fès. I would like to ask about the rights of craftsmen in Morocco in the case of suing the owner of the workshop when he expels you. How can you sue him for compensation for years you dedicated to him? Thank you!
With all honesty, traditional crafts are not an issue of interest for these officials because no one makes them accountable for their acts. May God help all artisans in Morocco! May God assist artisans! As for officials, God will judge them and may God help us! God will give us more than they can give us. My brothers and sisters, their conscience will torture them. Salam alikum my brother and sister artisans. May God help you! I am a dressmaker and I hope they will consider our situation.
Abdrahim. Salam. I am a carpenter. I call upon officials to find a solution for those young people. They are lost. Salam alikum.
Peace of God be upon you. I am a traditional artisan. In my opinion, traditional artisans don't want to show their products on the computer. This is because most artisans are illiterate. Dear minister, we need an initiative. Prices of materials have increased. The price of silisyoun glue has increased from 50 dirhams to 85 dirhams, dear minister. As for tanning material, dear minister, God has endowed us Moroccans with Maamoura forest extended over 133000 hectars, dear minister, but we still put tanning material for 460 dirhams for 46 kg. The price was initially 130 dirhams. We ask you sir for an urgent initiative. In my opinion, the computer is not the solution. The solution is the institution inaugurated by his majesty king Mohamed VI, may God assist him. There should be a branch where to sell and buy at official prices all year long. Dear minister, I have been working for 21 years in the field of traditional handicraft. I swear by God Who created this universe, I can't even make 300 dirhams. I have been sick for three days. I don't have money to pay a doctor. For more information, we are in the handicraft shops in Fès. Salam alikum.
Thank you for your efforts.
Sahara is Moroccan without comment.
The best thing presented by T7 channel see if there's something good in this channel the rest is all dreary, Zaki ALG HAAAAAAAA
Keeping silent to the mad is considered an answer.
By the way, I address my warmest congratulations for Tunisians with their determination and sport spirit which we have as well. I sent you dear ones everything I have in my life.
May God protect our sheikh Ali Farkous. Salam alikum.
Salam. I am Nassima. I am 9. I was born on 01/06/1999 in Meknes. This means that the dear country is Morocco. I will never relinquish it whether young or old. I love you Morocco.
Enough lies, you have depleted the pockets of the people!
Salam alikum. I want software through which the citizen can communicate via the internet to the phone, please. Wishing you more success! Thank you!
Hi Jamel, I love you so much.
Salam alikum. I study in the first year of the baccalaureate, economics. I want to know, may God preserve you, if this branch has horizons or not. May God reward you with good. Happy Ramadan.
This is nice.
Salam alikum. To say the truth, by God, these Brotherhoods are the biggest hypocrites. I think that corruption by veiled women is worse than naked women. I was with a woman who wears hijab, she wanted me to have sex with her. God is witness to what I say. I saw a woman who wears hijab playing football in shorts while her friends who don't wear Hijab wearing trousers. This is a shame! Offer advice to your sisters, offer advice to your wives, then advice people on the street. God knows better. Nour.
Salam alikum. I am a student who has passed the baccalaureate this year without distinction. I want to ask you whether I can study in France.
I'm Jihane I live in Morocco I love Hajar, English
I understood nothing. Do you want debauchery? May God protect us!
Good because there is no respect any more in the way of dressing.
In Morocco, there aren't many people who study experimental sciences and technology because they are scared about major subjects in these branches. For me, I wanted to study economics but they told me this will be possible after the 5th year. So I did experimental sciences and was very good. Those who want to study, work hard even if they face any difficulties. Blessed Ramadan.
The technology branch has many horizons.
Salam alaikoum. I think that the coach of the national team is Mr Badou Zaki because he knows well the Moroccan football, he knows players who are jealous for the country. But if they keep on like this in gossip. I encourage Algerian better, we're a very poor nation and they're eating our resources and I have the proof they were going Chamakh, Hossine Kharja, Wado, they were drinking alcohol with them and even girls were with them by God? They took two players Abd Arazak Lamnasfi, Jaouad Wadoch and the goalkeeper Adil Razaki Zali + Zaki = Save the national team.
The bread of the house is eaten by the stranger, there's nothing new for us, it's always been like that. When will Algeria take care of its sons and its artists?
From here begins Amazigh. Amazigh and Islam will rule the world.
Kadhafi deserved to be killed. I support them. Viva Algeria!
My name is Mariam from Marrakech. I am a widow. I have one daughter, she is 15. I would like to buy a house in social housing. I have paid the first and second installments in Tamalalt. They told me that the residue will be paid by the bank and another side told me it would pay it. I personally want them to tell me how much I will have to pay and the duration without resorting to the bank. I want a convincing reply please!
Salam alikum. How are you? I hope you are all well. Thank you very much for granting us an opportunity to contribute our opinions. It is certain that star academy produces a new generation to the musical scene. However, we Moroccans have this wish before we are accepted. But when we go to Beirut they are arrogant and have new thoughts. They don't go on with what they have gone for. They play and make boyfriends with any guy from any country. Thank you. Bye.
For those who supported NATO, the day will come for you rats! You aren't Muslim. You are crusaders. You will see crusaders in the post-Kadhafi, a man. You will call for help and won't be rescued rats!
I am a Moroccan young man. I am 27. I work in Dilphe company. My monthly salary varies between 2500 and 3000 dirhams. I would like to buy a house in Complexe Doha in the city of Tangier. So what is the solution? Thank you! **Phone number removed by editor**

Please, I work in free trade. I sell clothes. I don't have a shop. What are the necessary papers in order to buy an apartment? May God reward you with good.
Salam alikum. I want the phone number of Fogarim loans. Thank you!
Is it possible for me to take a loan? I work without official papers. My salary is 2000 dirhams. I hope you will reply very soon, God willing! Thank you very much!

Driver or work as a painter.
Is there an institution which takes care of adjusting papers?
I hope that the condition of Moroccans in Libya improves.
Thank you for these comments! My brothers, I have one question please. Is there a company that helps in immigration from Morocco to Libya?

No, no, terrorism is banned, totally banned! I don't like terrorism, they are destructors of origins, no, no, no, no!
Hhhh, what is this ugly Caftan?
Hi Hakim, this is Anis Djijilen, my brother you're steel, may God protect you. Good luck my brother.
This is a really nice article. A nice festival, thank you.
All this film is nice. Its story is very nice but what stains the film is Haifa Wehbe, I don't like her.
My name is Laila. I study in the third year of the lower secondary. I would like to learn the English language.
Illegal immigration is one of the situations of famine.
We always say never mind, the most important thing is to participate! These words have become a custom for us. However, when the national team wins, we say our national team is good. The salary of Gerets has become a red line with many other lines. Only God knows how much the president of the football federation gains!!!
A nice and interesting topic thank you very much.
I am a graduate young man in law. I suffered so much from unemployment…Morocco is a country of dictatorship and oppression, dishonest bellies, thieves who ate the money of the people…I managed to immigrate illegally to Europe the country of dignity and humanity. I found dignified life which I was deprived of…Bye Morocco.
Moroccans brought back the smell to the world; to make things worse, they granted an opportunity to Gerets without holding him accountable for this scandal even though we have coaches who lift the flag of Morocco in many African events.
I would like to join vocational training, God willing! I dropped out of school from the lower secondary, God willing!
In the name of God the most gracious the most merciful. I don't agree with homosexuality. It is banned in our religion. Authorities must firmly fight this phenomenon because it is a malign virus which is spreading in our society. Thank you.
I am a young girl from Rabat. I am 17. I don't like studies. I would like to register in vocational training. Do you have any adequate institution for my age and a suitable place?
By God, I don't know what to say about this disbeliever in God. But there are some who deserve the same thing like him.
Viva Kadhafi! All Libya are his sons, o dogs and rats!
I salute all the Libyan people for their resistance and struggle in the face of the tyrant. Every oppressor has an end. God waits but doesn't forget.
From God we are.
This is a good move, an excellent work. What about prostitution which is widely spread and is exported to other parts of the world? There is now a prostitution mafia in Morocco, the honourable country!!!???
I study in vocational training. I study in a boarding school in Agadir. Studies aren't bad. However, food we eat in the boarding school isn't good. I hope that authorities or responsible committee will control this and help us solve this problem.
Salam brothers how are you? You are also fans of Nass El Ghiwane.
Salam. My name is Abdollah. I live in Taroudant. I am 14. I would like to play in the school of Real Madrid. I love Real more than any other team. I hope you will accept my request.
I love Hind Sabri very much and consider her like my sister. I wish I can talk to her because I have something important to tell her. Please Hind if you read this let me know please!
One of the best Arab groups, I wish Nass El Ghiwane more success, continuity and more giving, as we're always longing to their songs, long live Nass El Ghiwane, thank you for this choice, thanks
Peace of God be upon you. I am a young man, I live in Morocco. I am looking for someone to help me start my building business. I have experience in this. I am 23. Thank you for your help!
Peace, mercy and blessings of God be upon you. I am a young man, 25. I have a diploma in aluminum carpentry. I hope to find someone to help me set up a moukawalati project. Thank you!
Is it possible to get help in small projects and how?

I am Khadija from Morocco. I need help. I am a hairdresser. I only work with others. I would like to open my own business. I want to buy a shop where I can work so that I won't have to rent. I would use rental money to pay my own shop. Please I want help!
Congratulations, Antar. It's true that Ziani is young. I hope you will take my email to communicate with me. I say to the beauty, I love you so much. I love you all so much. My friend loves Ziani, Samouha Sara. We call her Sasou. Another one Samouha Mamia dies for Yebda. I love you so much. Maryouma is also my friend; she loves Megheni. I die for Bougera. I die for him. I love you and your wife. Bye Antar!
I am a Moroccan young man. I want to set up a small business in building. I want help if possible. I want to know more about how to get a loan from this association. Thank you!
Salam. I have one question. I live in Spain. I would like to apply for a loan. Is that possible? What are necessary papers and how much do I have to pay as downpayment if the house costs 250000 dirhams? Thank you!
I support the Tunisian people. I hope their situation will improve. May God help them in good and hard times.
Ahmed Fakruon super music
I love all the students namely Hajar, Farah, Hamid, Ahmed and Yousra, thank you, Znati from Guercif, Morocco
I vote for Abdelhamid
A good initiative by the King Mohamed 6 I hope, what a reward to you the king of the poor, be like a palm tree high in the sky, it's targeted by stones and it throws the best fruits to people.
Thank you for this, hahaha!
These achkayn hhhhhhhh say bad words.
God bless you H-kayne, always to the top. Although I'm not from Meknès I'm proud of your town, long live hip hop.
I love this group. For me it's nice, God bless the people of Meknès. I'm always proud of them even if I'm not from Meknès but Oujda.
H-kayne is nothing, I can't say anything, with wishes of success inchallah.
Long lives FAR RABAT!
Salam. My name is Kawtar from Casablanca. I am a dressmaker. I like this job a lot and wish to sew for you some Moroccan Caftan. I hope you would like it.
Salam. I am a tailor. I sew traditional dresses and would like to know more about this field. Can you help me? Thank you!
New models of Caftan please!
Salam. I am Nadira from Meknès. This is the first time I read this site. I like it so much because I like so much the Moroccan Caftan.
Nice picture, God bless you!
Every people have the right to expression their opinion and found their party. We are Amazigh and will remain Amazigh to death!
Anyway, in Morocco there is no difference between Amazigh and Arabs in terms of setting up or looking for parties. We want to set up a democratic state without problems. Regardless of the number of languages in Morocco, it will remain a united country. We don't want any kind of problems in our country.
I am against all this which is offending the messenger, peace and blessings of God be upon him.
Hi! I am crazy about the Moroccan Caftan and Djellaba. I wish to all Moroccan women to preserve our authenticity. Zineb from Paris.
I would like to know if there is new training available in Messassefa and will it begin?
The problem is that there is no methodical policy that secures equal opportunities. The government should be rational.
I can't deny the internet is entertaining and interesting. However, it is easy to get into a relationship, but it won't last for long. I prefer the popular way.
Hi, I want to say that Hajar and Abdelhamid are very very very dear to me, and I always view them and good luck
Hajar is the star, from Salim Laheg, Algeria
Nice clothes. I hope I have clothes like them.
Salam alikum, my brothers. Praise be to God, I passed the bac this year. I say to everyone who passed: congratulations! As for those who didn't pass this year, I tell them don't be desperate, but don't be lazy! Work hard next year!
Please this is my exam number 30415, have I passed or not?
I want you to explain to me if I can join the university, even though I studied art, not science.
I ask the honourable sirs to inform us about the announcement of results. Thank you!
My darling I am sorry for you. Kisses.
OK, I am a daughter of Marrakesh. I play in Marrakesh. But we don't have a league. We are not affiliated in the league - why? I don't know. Now we have a contract with Fqih Ben Saleh. This is good even if we won't represent Marrakesh, but it is OK.
This is a shame, they deserve execution, by God!
I want to start a business of Moroccan pastry because I am expert in this. I want to help my husband in household expenses. However, I don't have a capital. I don't want to start with a loan as this requires time. Please guide me to a solution as I need so much this project. Thank you!
Viva Justice and Development party
Salam, Settat, how are you. Rap as we have said is a fashion today which means that rap nowadays is very famous. I greet all Settat rap, you're great, go ahead, Moroccan rap.
Casa Crew is the best rap band in Morocco. Casa Crew forever. Thank you.
I hope from God this Algerian border will remain closed forever. I hope a wall bigger than the wall of Berlin will be built there so that every country would run its country on its own as if it has no neighbours. That's all. We Moroccans have never asked for any aids from anyone. We are proud and our history bears witness about us. Ask your grandfathers and they will tell you who Moroccans are. History bears witness. History bears witness.
We Moroccans and Algerians are all brothers.
The national team will win, God willing. But we need quickness in the front line, ok. Distributors Jawad Zairi, Al Hamdaoui, Hajji and Chamakh.
My name is Soukaina from Salé. I like the roles you played, your personality and your good manners. I wish you success and good luck in your artistic career because you are an excellent actor and this is well-deserved. I love you. My warm kisses to you.
Bado Zaki!
I am Moroccan. I want borders to be open with Algerians. Those who say who say Algeria doesn't need Moroccans should know that Berkane, Oujda and Newadra in the orient boost Algerian economy (fuel).
Zaki must come back.
I am an Amazigh Algerian. I love Morocco. I hope they will qualify to CAN. Algerians love Moroccans.
I am Hanafi from the city of Agadir. I hope that the Moroccan federation will call Badou Zaki to the national team. It is him who gives opportunities like 2004. I hope he will come back to the national team in order to reform the team to show their strength and give an opportunity to non-professional players to be professional. Badou Zaki forever.
We don't disagree that the national team needs Zaki. However, what happened yesterday is not the same as today. This was the same with Michel when he was with the team in 1998, everything was fine. I hope that Zaki won't return to the national team so that he will remain great in all our eyes and we will always keep on saying long live Zaki. I recommend an Argentine coach like Oscar Felon.
Atlas lions were serious in matches. However, the weak point was the goalie and wings. Thank you.
God bless all our Moroccans Hajar and Hamid, we thank Nessma for this nice initiative and hope it'll be Moroccan.
Hi students! I like Hajar and Badrou so much. I love you so much and Yousra don't be so arrogant, you're a young woman.
Hi everyone, I really love you Hamid and hope to see you singing in a soirée a Gnaoui song and long live BARCA
Always Gnawa and always BARCA
Congratulations to Nader, the Tunisian.
Bravo Nadoura, I love you. May God help you in your artistic career.
I salute you, Nader, from all my heart, Diaa, Kwaydek, Mirhane, Mehelawi, Bouchoucha and Saad and everyone present in Star Academy. You deserve the title of Star. Thank you from Basma in Morocco, Casa. Chai you are the nicest, Mima and Assma I love you so much.
What is going on in our country?
I want my husband to have sex only with me. I want an easy way to imprison him sexually (Thekaf).
Don't you see there is the Day Of Judgment and you won't die?
Salam alikum. I want a summary about clairvoyance in Morocco in French.
By God o salafist brothers, you are making things worse. I am against nakedness. But assaulting a Muslim girl, this is between her and God. Who are you? Are you the ones who decree and make fatwas unknowingly? If this was my sister and I got hold of that salafist, I would burn him with fuel. I am crazy, crazy, crazy, Alpha what are you doing, O enemies of the Islamic religion, you have disfigured our religion! You are just infidels, riffraff you and disgraceful acts you claim Salafism as the poet said shame on you! You can come by and prohibit! Shame on you like it if they did a great.
Woman is the key of society. If she is corrupt, society will be corrupt. If she is good, society will be good. Therefore, woman must cover her intimate parts because she fascinates men. So, o women, our mothers, our sisters, our daughters and our wives, the essence of woman is her intimate parts. If her intimate parts are uncovered, her essnce is lost. Ali Lho Tajda.
Moroccans are great always making a fuss even on the internet. Do you have reason or not?
Salam. You kept on observing them until the Moroccans were the first to be eliminated. But nothing to do ok. Bye bye.
I think the national exam was very difficult this year, especially because the level of Moroccan pupils is very weak. I hope that officials will understand this and make the second session doable.
Honestly the exam of the second session is also very difficult especially for arts students. They exhausted us. If it is just for Morocco, it is ruined. The solution is be patient and keep quiet.
To say the truth, the regular session of the bac was very easy. This means that questions were good but the numerous lessons confused us. I wish success to students in the second session which is a valuable opportunity for you. Wish you good results God willing. There is good in what God chooses.
Lazy boys, you don't want to study. Regret is of no use.
Salam. Thank you very much for the help. On Saturday, I have an exam about the contribution of Morocco in World War II. I found three axes but I can't find the fourth, which is the results of the contribution of Morocco in the war. Moreover, you don't show pictures, maps or tables. I want please the results and pictures about this topic. Thank you.
Thank you very much for this nice site. I hope to see more research. Bye.
I want to thank you for the assistance.
Thank you for the information.
Thank you for these comments, brothers and sisters.
I divorced in the month 1 in 2009. I will complete my legal retreat God willing and I will marry. I had one son with him. He is one year. I would like to know whether he will take my son if I marry. Salam alikum. I am Hanan from Agadir.
A very interesting topic but not comprehensive of all the problems of women. There are still issues which weren't tackled by the family code.
Salam alikum. I am 26. I love a man but he is married. But he is not in good terms with his wife because it was his mother who married him to her. Now we love each other and want to marry. I want to ask whether the approval of the first wife is no longer necessary. Please reply via msn as soon as possible. I love him and we have been together for years.
Salam alikum. I am 26, I love a guy but he is married. They don't understand each other because it was his mother who married him to her. Now, we love each other and want to marry. I want to ask whether they have withdrawn the approval of the wife or not. Reply to me please on my msn as soon as possible. I love him and we have been together for years.
I married my cousin even though I didn't want her. My mother married her to me. We have a daughter. I got acquainted with a girl and now I love her. I like her and want to marry her. When her family found out I was married, they refused to marry her to me. I don't know what to do. Tell me a solution.
I advise Hind to go to justice. Justice will give you your right. Don't worry, there is a law. He must marry you and recognise his son or daughter. Justice will not imprison you. They will just tell you that you have made a big mistake because you trusted such man, since he divorced you, you shouldn't have trusted him. Be careful. Go to justice, it will be on your side I am sure. Go to a lawyer to tell you what to do. Good luck.
In fact all the topics I read are good but it is important to find a solution. I hope to God that we find a solution and our Morocco becomes nice. Long live Morocco. Long live the king.
Salam. My problem is that I have been married for five years. I have a son who is 2. My wife is pregnant in 7 months. She insists on divorce. I did her a lot of wrong. But I have repented and want my wife and kids. But she refuses. She wants divorce. Her parents tell her to divorce. I am tired. By God, I want a solution.
There is no power and no will but from God, we forgot that we are Muslims before anything else.
This is something great. I can't express my opinion. I want to say thank you very much.
I congratulate you for this score. I wish you a good luck and 1000000000000000 congratulations.
Salam Hoda. I am from Morocco and a student in the baccalaureate. Before I forget, I congratulate your score in Morocco. It is certain it was a great effort and hard work. I also wish success to everyone. God bless you. I wish you a successful future sister.
Hi, a nice site.
May God rest the soul of those who said the first left nothing to say for the the last. God suffices us. We are in the state where the right is missing and law remains.
May God guide you, this is Algeria you are destroying. Is this how you express your manhood?
I'm a girl from Morocco nadia 16 years old I like reda taliani yasr yasr pls if anyone has his personal email give it to me because I'm suffering without him
I want to enter.
This is interesting!
I liked your topic because it is very interesting especially for young people like me.
I want to be part of the centre.
I ask you to give me addresses of Moroccan associations for AIDS or their phone numbers. Thank you!
The problem of terrorism is in the region especially the border region in Tamanrasset.
We got rid of Chokri Belaid.
Good luck go ahead, nice idea successful towards the Maghreb union thanks to those who contributed to this hope Oum Maha
I love star academy and abdo hajar farah kawtar djamel farid
We are in an Islamic country. If you believe in God and His prophet, why do you support short dresses? Are you Muslims? You are calling for corruption.
I love you fnair so much you are very good I want to congratulate you a lot and want to encourage you. Go on in expressing the feelings of the Moroccan young people and their problems.
You're the best rap group I know.
Fnaire forever, and may God preserve your Lala Mnana
Salam my brother Youness and all the Migri brothers. God bless you both in cinema and music.
In the name of God the most gracious the most merciful. The Libyan people will regret it and will realise that they have committed a big mistake against their president. They will regret it when it will be too late. Libya will become formally Arab but in the content western. If you want to correct your mistake, return to your religion. Salam.
Shame on you to talk about the dead.
Sir, God waits but does not forget. Where is Pharaoh? Where is Sharon? Where is Namroud? Where is Hitler? If Kadhafi was with God, he would have had a better death because he said I have millions with me, where are your millions monkey-Dhafi?
Salam. I hail from the city of Khmisset. I would like to join your institution. I would like to know what the conditions are to join this academy. Thank you!
I'm pregnant. I'd like my mother to come to Belgium, but the remaining period is not enough to submit the passport. Is there a solution to this predicament?
Salam. If this singer wants to do any good in the world, she should retire and spare us this indecency, this is a shame and indecent. She should go, guard her private parts, observe her duty to God and learn from what happened to her last time when she was on the verge of death but God saved her. She should do something good before she dies and God grants you an opportunity but does not neglect.
I don't like Haifa.
There is no power, is this a life? Arabs aren't even securing themselves and want to play with USA.
Salaaam I want to listen to the song of Malek and Bouchnak "Mabka Lina Amal" (there's no hope left for us) plz
A good site.
Hi Badro, you are a star.
Hi I'm Nariman from Morocco I like Badro Din so much. I want you to give me his email. I want to talk to him.
I'm Hicham from Safi. For me, it's the programmes which should look for talents. There are talents in singing but they're not acknowledged, for example… me.
God is the greatest! Victory is for Islam. Mohammed is the messenger of God.
Yes, yes Soufiane my friend. But don't think of getting close to Sabre, you will regret it my son, hhhh. I will keep throwing you down. Lol. Take care of yourself honey.
This news which came from the people who don't care about the future. You see others sweeping Arabs but Arabs are still justifying their reply.
God loves those who love Him.
There is no other god but God, Mohammed is the messenger of God. God is the greatest!
God is the greatest!
This information is serious that she left Qur'an to sing. This is unacceptable Bassma what you did. I voted for you, but no luck. Next year, God willing a Moroccan will take it.
Unfortunately Bassma hasn't taken the title. This is not important. She is always a star in our eyes. You have honoured us.
Salam alikoum. No to violence against innocent Muslims.
Bin Laden is a Muslim who loves Islam and defends it, but all he does is make threats. He can do nothing, so it would be better for him to kill himself.
Cheb Khaled is one of the singers I listen to a lot because he sings in a language understood by all Moroccans. Moreover, his music makes him different from other artists. Therefore, he deserves the title of "King of Rai".
In reality, this is frightening. I see that young people are defending freedom of depravity. Are you men? Brothers, you are calling for freedom and are contradicting the Sharia of God. Girls have gone too far, always naked. What religion do you have? If you cuckold go to mosque and defend the semi-naked women, it is clear that you would like your daughters to be naked or even your wife. May Allah increase the disease of your hearts! My brothers, I know there are still men in Morocco, praise be to God! This is frightening. How can a girl be naked and they defend her? Look, we are Muslims, whether you like it or not, we have an Islamic mentality, praise be to God. God will grant us victory. This is haram, there should be no nakedness. As far as I am concerned, they did well to her so that she would learn to cover herself. If you see a vice, change it! Praise be to God for the grace of Islam! These girls who are here defending, most of you have Muslim names, but you are nothing. You are semi-naked hypocrites. As for the immoral who defend the semi naked, they are cuckolds who don't feel the smell of paradise. There is no power and no will but from God the greatest! By God, repent to God! I apologise if I have insulted you but I can't keep quiet about a vice.
I dropped out of school three years ago from the third year of the lower secondary. I would like to register in vocational training. What are necessary conditions? Thank you! Salam.
I am addicted to drugs but they calm me down. If there were no drugs, there would be anarchy in the country. Greetings- Thank you.
The challenge of drugs is the real factor that determines development and prosperity in Moroccan society. While we do not see any shortage in all kinds of drugs in Moroccan streets as if there is a policy that imposes this reality, it even makes efforts to spread it. How can we fight this plight when drug dealers in every district do their best to keep the business growing!
Salam. I presented a project to Moukawalati and it was accepted. However, I don't have a warranty. I have a tribal land but it is not my property. I have been waiting for one year for the representative of local authorities to sign it but I am still waiting because the delegate of communal lands is absent. I don't know what the solution is.
I need your help. I want to set up a business for manufacturing cotton. I need your help as soon as possible to do this project.
Salam. What are steps to set up a business? Thank you!
Salam alikum. First of all, thank you for your interest in young people because they are the pillars of society. I am a young man, 33. I would like to set up a business. It is a small restaurant. I have experience in this field and would like to know necessary measures.
Casawa Casawa Hamid, Hajar and Farah. Long live Lbernoussi.
I am very happy about this work you are interested in. I really hope to participate with you in this practical field. I sincerely hope to.
I love you so much.
Look brother Bilal, there is no one like you in singing. Those who don't like you should go away, we don't want them. As you said "what's wrong with you our enemies following us, close your mouths. God is with us and God is our mandate against you." By God, dignity to my brother Bilal. I am Abdou from Oujda. Unfortunately, I wasn't in that festival 2009. I wish to see you in Oujda, pride to my brother Bilal. By God you're in the heart king of rai! May God protect you and preserve you for us, amen my Lord! Take care Bilal so much, you're very dear to us!
Salam. I am Hicham. I live in Inezgane, Tarraste. I congratulate Cheb Bilal on all his albums. We want more of your albums. I thank the technical staff who work with him. I hope that when you will introduce your new album, you will be proud of Inezgane and Taraste people in particular who are proud of you Bilal. We want you to be present in Timitar festival this year 2010. I thank Cheb Bilal. You're in the heart and you will never come out from it. When you will make a new album, be proud of Tarraste.
I am Saida. I want to undergo a plastic surgery to the nose at the best specialists in this sector. Is there an efficient treatment to completely cure varicose veins? Please help me as I suffer so much. Thank you.
Especially the music of Lmakhlouk and if they're happy for you. Bilal forever! I love music.
Bilal is a great singer. I have been waiting for him since 1994. His songs are the best in the world, especially those he sang before 2004, because with recent songs, he seems to be trying to gain fans in general, not admirers and lovers.
Send me the song of Cheb Jelloul 'Nti El Capitale'
Personally, I find that most programmes are useless.
Salam alaikoum people of good inchallah. Ok, pop music is NO COMMENT. The sheikhs said play and amuse yourselves don't worry about anything, be happy with your fate. God will grant you, if He grants you. He's never bored or tight-fisted, and if He endows you with little, do not be angry. Thank you for this site. It's imaginary and another world. Long live Allah and then MCA, Amar Ezzahi, Hamoud Boualem and the FLN (by default).
By God Ezahi.
Salam Amimer Sheikh Al Shioukh, may God protect him and grant him long life inchallah.
I love you Nancy, love.
I like Cheb Nasro, and greetings to the fans of Nasro and Nasro forever
Salam, I'm Mina from Morocco, the city of Tiznit the music which I like most is the Rai namely rai of Chab Nasro, Hasni forever
I love Nancy very much. I am from Morocco. Visit us. I hope to see you very soon. I am Talbi Fatima Zehra. I live in Agadir. Your albums are great. I love you. Thank you. Please come to Morocco, Agadir, please. Thank you.
O Lord protect us, o Lord of the worlds!
Where is Star Ac Maghreb programme? Where are its stars Hamid?
The city of Fez is one of the most beautiful Moroccan cities which I like because there are nice people in it. Its civilization is even nicer. It deserves all the respect and esteem from us not only because it is the greatest city for me but also its climate is nice even if it is very hot in the summer. But it is nice. I thank you for reading. Peace, mercy and blessings of God be upon you.
Thank you Amazigh people of the Rif, 2009 a protest in the Rif, human rights, the young people of the Rif have no future they must solve this problem.
I love dialogue.
We hope we put an end to the corruption in Arab countries in general and Morocco in particular, otherwise something bad and unexpected by anyone will happen especially DST which think they are active. We have to be careful!
Greetings to you sons of Tlili. We're Amazigh people, we were born Amazighs and we're still Amazighs. We won't forget as long as our blood is Amazigh. We will defend our Amazigh identity until death.
Today or tomorrow, Tamazight is certain.
Ok there is nothing we can do but go and sit for the second session. May God take revenge on the teachers who graded my papers. This is all I can say. Good luck everyone.
Salam alikoum. Look guys of Alal Al Fassi, even if you study day and night you won't pass. There are no studies in Tangier Alal, all the students pass with a satisfactory pass only.
This is unacceptable, by God, unacceptable, God suffices me and he is the best protector. May God take revenge on the person who made me fail. I will claim my rights with my hands whether I pass this baccalaureate or not. It is like finding a treasure. Praise be to God for every good thing. A greeting from Ouazzane to all the Moroccan students.
Thank you Yousra for that nice advice. Can you tell me what was grade in the regional exam and with which grade you got the baccalaureate?
I love you Ghazzal. I love you so much, my life. Viva Algeria! God willing, we will bring home the World Cup, oh Lord, and go to Italy, God willing, for the sake of Ghazzal. My life's wish for you is success always.
Salam. What I wanted to say is that if God ordered that you repeat the academic year, you must study and make an effort, God will help. I personally didn't passed the baccalaureate last year. I repeated the year. Praise be to God, as I passed this year. You need only patience and determination, you must work alone, don't rely on anyone and God willing you will get good results. There is no despair with life. May God grant you success and make difficult things easy for you.
I don't want the borders with Algeria opened because Morocco benefits more from the situation. The Sahara is and will remain Moroccan despite your schemes. Are you not tired of squandering your money on countries to recognize the Polisario? This is why you have such a high rate of unemployment. Wake up Algerians, you have have been in deep slumber.
The stadium should be built in Sidi Moumen.
Raja forever!
Raja forever!
Nice.
Hi. I would like to know whether I passed or not through the internet. How can I do this?
The Algerian justice is mere ink on paper.
What are horizons of pupils after the baccalaureate? There is no guidance. We are confused and don't know what to do.
I am Dounia. I study in the baccalaureate, economics. It is a difficult branch even if I have made an effort in the regional exam. But I got a bad score not giving hope to pass in the baccalaureate. I hope to pass and get the baccalaureate. I will do all my efforts. Oh Lord accept from me to get the certificate. I wish success to everyone, oh Lord.
I don't want to talk about my story with the baccalaureate because my morale is low. I want to say that I was one of the candidates in this war, but I wasn't successful because my score in the regional exam was 11.04 and my score in the class exam was 13.89. But I don't think it was enough to pass a bloody war, because I was unarmed. However, my friend had 5.67 in the regional and 13 in the class exam, but was lucky enough to pass. What can I say? May God guide the exam correctors and the Ministry of Education. May God take revenge. I won't forgive those who were unjust to me before God.
It is not a ministry of education. It is a ministry of injustice, exclusion and marginalization. Why talk about failure rates? Haven't you asked about the rate of injustice? Let me tell you in this way, this country will never move forward or even think about it. It has to remove illegitimate hands. Finally, the baccalaureate is just luck. Trust me my brothers. My story with it is saddening. May God take revenge. May God take revenge. May God take revenge.
Oh Lord this is enormous! Can we afford this law? If you want to implement this law, you must first repair roads.
We've noticed there are many lessons. The regional exam is the only trick that makes pupils fail for the year, as well as the agreement of the ministry, which decides the rate of success. I hope they'll try to change these decisions, because they don't serve the interests of the pupils. Pupils need baccalaureate diplomas because they are the only key to work in our country.
I see that there is discrimination in these results. Oh people, you work only with bribery, have some shame!
You hear that?
Which measures will be adopted in the exam in 2010?
Why are orientation officers the ones who guide us? I wanted to do economics but they sent me to sciences. Now I am moving from high school to high school to appeal. Why????
I am a student, I passed the baccalaureate in the subject of sciences SVT. I don't know what to do. I want you to help me. Thank you!
I wish success to us and all Muslim young people!
Reform schools and give an opportunity to art students.
We would like to know the prospects for literature students.
Hi brother, how are you? What is the score you passed the baccalaureate in SVT and what are you doing now? In what do you follow your studies? Anyway, I hope you will advise me because this year I am studying the same course, that is to say SVT.
Our Tunisian movies lack some suspense. Always almost the same idea. It is better than nothing. But we hope they will make more than one film in a year like Egypt.
salam alaikoum
A call for indulgence to all the people.
Moroccans are good at nothing they're Moroccans always in 000000 zero. Long live Bado Zaki and Abdessalam Ouadou.
To the fans of the Moroccan national team, we ask you to support Badou Zaki so that he can come back to his place in the national team because Lemerre will never be of any use to the national team. Let's all be with Zaki our hero who has a Moroccan nationality, a Moroccan and international popularity. Our slogan is Zaki.
I want to study physics but I don't know which subjects will help me in my studies. Please reply.
I am a fan of Esperance because it is a strong team! Long lives Real Madrid and long lives RAJA Casablanca!
Salam. How are you? The problem isn't that of a foreign or local coach. The problem is with the federation because there is laziness, bribery and administrative corruption in the federation. If we want to be better, we must reconsider the federation so that there will be a cell which works for the Moroccan people and for personal interests. Thank you very much. A fan of the national team.
Why haven't you replied regarding my choice of the technical branch? I am very confused. I study in the third year of the lower secondary. Please help me.
Why don't you answer questions we send you? We want someone to guide us because we haven't yet taken a decision. Please reply. I sent you many messages. We want to choose the technical branch but we haven't taken a decision yet.
Victory for Muslims!
You are treated in the same way you treat others.
Rebels have lost a brave leader. They won't find anyone like him no matter what it takes. Moamer was the one who was calling for the unity of Arabs and spoke out when Saddam Hussein was killed. He is the lion of lions of Africa.
Salam alikum. Some brothers have made valuable and interesting questions. But where are the answers?
May God rest the soul of martyr Moamer Kadhafu, God willing, lions will remain lions and rats will remain rats! Moamer Kadhafi is a hero, defeater of America. But unfortunately there were the Libyan traitors.
Salam alikum. I am a young man. I live in harsh housing conditions. I need help in housing. Please my Moroccan brothers help me find a house.
I am a tenured worker in this company.
I find this magazine interesting. God willing Algeria will win!
May God guide with salvation.
Hi, how are you, I'm Karim frim Morocco, I want to greet all the students
too many returns, that's too much
Zidane is Amazigh, not Arab.
Bravo Jawad, you must come back to the national team of Morocco.
Jawad must return to the national team.
Salam. Honestly, this new Code is not suitable for poor people. We hope from God to bring some solution.
Yes I am in favour of putting wheel clamps because most citizens in Morocco don't respect the traffic code.
Peace, mercy and blessings of God be upon you. I inform you that your channel is very popular in Belgium. We hope that your programmes will be developed more. For example, you may raise social and political issues associated with religion. Salam. Wish you success.
Morocco is...one of the nicest countries but...
I am proud of Kadhafi. He died as a hero. You will regret it when it is too late. You sold your country to disbelievers. You will live in poverty and no one will help you, o country of martyrs!
We Moroccans are very talkative. We want action. So show us how to make Azzouz fall as he have secured the title and safe. Show to the Arab world we are all with Bassouma the starac 2009. I prefer to die rather than see Abdelaziz win. Oh God, I hate him.
The album of Nas El Ghiwane is very nice
I am honoured to write this. I love Mohamed VI. Long live our king!
I support you in this project because this project is great. I ask God long life for this project. Thanks for opening this dialogue for us.
Bassma, you're the star. I wished you stayed with Yahya. Anyway, Brahim the hypocrite is the cause.
I love Nass El Ghiwane and I adore them and I greet them for their last video clip
Anonymous. Honestly, well done Libya and Tunisia! No matter what happens, we won't disagree.
I want to study scientific subjects but physics teacher doesn't teach well. I ask the state to find a good teacher for the school of Sidi Moman, Casa.
I love all Rai music especially that of Mami!
Yes, we wish success to Mami but not Hasni.
I love Nancy Ajram
Hajar I love you I'm from Morocco (Ifrane) I like you and wish you were beside me now, you're the most beautiful in the academy, you're the star, as Chada has won, you will also win, (Safae Rehiouo)
How are you I'm Abdelali from Morocco, Hajar you're the most beautiful in the academy, you're the star
They are all lying!
I'll be with the FAR till the grave. Always Wadouch and always FAR, because they're a team with a long history.
Always FAR from here ultra FAR Rabat always faithful
Concerning changing the flag of the country, this is not the real problem of the country. Our real problem is how to improve the country.
You have your religion and I have my own religion.
I want to know my points in the social security.
Everything said about violation of human rights in the Moroccan Sahara is just untrue words circulated by the supporters of factionaries and supporters of Arab fragmentation. Enough, I tell you in the name of all the Moroccan people stop lying and deceiving. Morocco is the first country and the high model to the North African peoples in the field of democracy and respect of human rights. We don't deny that there are mistakes, but the situation isn't as dark as that. (Better than anyone...and everyone).
Salam, I hope that Abdelhamid will be the star.
All candidates are up to the level.
Hajar is always the star and wish her to be the star
Where's my beauty.
I want to join vocational training. I am not studying.
I hope that Maghreb star academy will be like last year and hope that you reply to my question. Why hasn't Hajar gone on tour with her friends?
I wish success to the stars of Maghreb star academy 2 and success in their artistic career. I hope that they will do their best.
I am a young man, 20. I dropped out of school since the second year or the lower secondary for personal reasons. Now I am unemployed. I would like to join a vocational training centre. Is this possible for me? Thank you!
I love Chahinas, I am Kawtar from Morocco, I wish you success.
Salam. I will reply to sister Nihal. Concerning conditions to study secretary subject, you should have studied up to the baccalaureate level in literature or any other subject. There aren't any conditions in this subject. It is also nice. I hope you will learn from it. Thank you!
Salam. Honestly, this Moroccan law is 0000 zero! Wherever you go, they tell you something different. Honestly, may God take revenge on them! I was about to marry, I brought all necessary papers. But they said you still need more papers. But why didn't you tell me in the first place? They just want money. They gave the paper only after I paid 500 dirhams. I went to see someone else, he said the man has to bring another paper from his country. This Morocco is full of corruption. Forgive me people of law for these words but this is the truth. May God take revenge! They should offer help so that girls marry but they are making things difficult. Moroccans girls are lost, they are taking to prostitution! Thank you!
I love you! All of Morocco is with you. I love you, Diaa, more than Asmaa. Your voice is nice. I love you, Mustapha, Nadir, Mirhan and Shahinaz. May God assist you.
The Moroccan kaftan is deteriorating very much.
I like to wear traditional dresses and die for traditional dresses. I hope that Moroccan women will preserve our traditional dress and not forget the authenticity of the caftan, jellaba and takchita. Thanks to every woman who read and preserved the authenticity of our country.
I would like to see the traditional Tkchita.
It is ugly and even the woman who wears it is ugly. First of all, the woman who wears it should be beautiful not like this odious. The colour of the caftan should be red. Please change that girl! thank you!
Moroccan Caftan is the one worn by our mothers, sisters and wives because it represents Morocco in the best image. When foreigners visit us, they like it.
Hi everyone! I am a young girl, 23. I live in the city of Rabat. I work in the field of traditional dress-making. I love everything associated with it. I would like to introduce some modern touches to keep up with modern times for anyone interested.
I would like to work in this field. Can someone help me?
I would like to know where are the new electoral lists.
We all hope that this will make women football move ahead and watch games on some Moroccan channel. I also hope to find a team where I can play. I don't know what to do in order to find one. If you know some club, please guide me to it, may God reward you with good! Thank you and good luck!
There is no difference between men and women football. We should lift the flag of the country with women football because there is no difference between man and woman. I am personally a player of Moghreb Tangier. I have to show my skills because I am talented in football and I like it so much.
Salam. I love football. It is flowing in my blood. I call upon the ministry of youth and sport in particular to take care of young girls who love football. My problem is that I don't know any club in Marrakech where I can register. I am a daughter of Marrakech. I feel very sad when I see other women players in Arab countries very qualified while we Moroccans are lost. This is a call on behalf of all Moroccan women football players, you should find us a solution. My dream is to become a football player and be professional abroad. Thank you!
Annie, is it possible for me to play with you although I have never played with any team except the school team, I assure you I can do a lot for football; however, I haven't found any team. I hail from Nador. (a lover of football). Bye!
Salam. How are you? I live in Nador. You can come to train or set up a team. There are many girls who want to play and they aren't just any kind of girls. They play well. I assure you this. Anyway, you need the best. If you want, you can reply to me and I will tell you where to come. ok, thank you! You will win a lot, I promise you!
I am a young girl from Tangier. I would like to play with some team. However, I don't know where to go. I heard there is a team in Tangier and in Tetouan. May God reward you with good, anyone who has any information about the issue to reply to me. I am ready to play with any team without any problem whether in the North, Rabat, Casablanca or anywhere. Thank you!
Salam. I am a young girl from Tamnsourt (Marrakech). I love so much football. I hope to play with a team in Marrakech. Thank you!
Hi Nasro, how are you my brother? Come to A'mlila, welcome every time you want. Tarek from Ain A'mlila.
I love you so much Cheb Nasro you and Cheb Hasni.
Hi brother Nasro. How are you doing far from home? Take care of yourself. My greetings to the sweet Fatima, all the family and our friend Mounir, may God protect you for us forever. Your friend Badr from Nador.
No one can catch up with Nasro. Long live Nasro 1,000 times. I love you.
Hi, how are you brother Nasro?
May God assist and bless the army.
Everybody is free to choose to do whatever they wish and no one has the right to interfere with that because individual liberty ends where that of the other starts.
I like rap
I think that there's no problem with rap songs , and as they say, there are problems in the Moroccan society and rap talks about these problems with respects to the Moroccan people.
I love Mouhtassine's serving!
Thank you very much.
Arabs agreed not to agree. So there is no need to waste efforts behind the union. Thank you.
By God, enough with losers, the seed of El Béji is rotten, and you who haven't waken up, enough sleeping!
Salam alikum. Maghreb political parties must especially in this serious period we are experiencing, I think that the only means to establish an Arab union, they must establish a common Maghreb market to avoid this backwardness and fragility.
Salam. I love Badou Zaki and the Moroccan national team. We love Marwane Chamakh. We love Youssef Hajji. We love all players from our heart.
I am a free Moroccan from Oujda. Long live Mohamed VI and long live the Moroccan Sahara. Morocco calls for the preservation of the borders of the nation in the face of the world. This is an area where we are developed, poor people of the country, dancers. Our resources are in our country, our mother Morocco.
Morocco forever but if we have a local team which would die for the national shirt.
Salam alikum. I would like to greet players of the Moroccan national team for their patriotism which they have defended in Cameroon. By God we thank them and tell them you have made us happy though the draw is not enough. Anyway, we trust you when you play next games. This will be good for you and us. I wished Zaki were with you now. However we have two people in the federation who control the feelings of 37 million Moroccans. Look at the neighbouring Algerian national team what they did with the son of their country. Aren't you ashamed? God's curse on you to the Day of Judgment.
Bring Bado Zaki, always, forever, forever.
Zaki Zaki Zaki
Salam. I live in Spain for a long time. Spanish people prefer their citizens. In Morocco it is the opposite, they prefer foreigners in any field. Zaki reached the final, the expelled him and brought a foreigner. I want to know.
Salam to all the students, I encourage Hajar and Farah and hope that Ahmed will be the star, I love you so much Ahmed sing to me a song of your choice. Hanane, Morocco.
Hajar and Dounia you're star, Naima and Hayat de Aghbala
Always Badrou to the end
Hi Hajar, Hamid and Farah the Moroccans, hi Ahmed, but Ahmed let me frank with you I want Hajar or Hamid to be a star, and inchallah it will be like that, a kiss to Hajar and Hamid
Instead of joining hands and efforts in order to clean Arab countries from terrorism, you are wishing catastrophes for Algeria. O Lord turn the plot of plotters against them! O Lord protect our country and keep enemies away from it! Viva Algeria!
Viva Algeria!
With Zaki, we feel that football is Moroccan. 19 09 2010
This has become normal because this is Morocco. Just look and keep quiet and my brother Rachid Nini will complete the discussion.
Salam alikum. There is no power and no will but from God. Now that we see people who defend corruption, vice and nakedness! These are some signs of the Hour "women semi-naked". Fear Allah and He will make a way out for you. May God guide us and guide Muslim young people!
Why? What is wrong with you? Why are you complicated? Are you Tunisian or Gulf people? I hate you. This is garbage.
In reality, they did well to her.
Have some mercy! You have exaggerated too much in what you are doing. The problem is that this doesn't fit young girls of Morocco. Leave fashion for the people of Lebanon and Europe!
I am from Morocco but I will die for Algeria!
I wish everyone success.
Salam. I have a small project and want funding to develop it. Thank you!
I'm an admirer of the character of the Moroccan artist Samiya Akryou.
I hope the exam will take place under the best conditions. I wish everyone good luck!
Honestly, the exam is close. But I know I will have bad results. But since I can't study anymore needlessly, I will cheat whether I make it or not. I address a greeting to the best lover, Nabil.
I hope the exam this year will be accessible. We hope God grants everyone success!
Struggle my brothers!
More descriptions please!
By God, they are laughing at us. First of all, they must reform themselves from corruption and robbing the money of the people. Moreover, they must repair the nice roads. They are the worst roads in the world, are our roads. Mr Ghaleb just thought of bringing the code from Sweden. Exalted be God, they always begin from the top. You must repair the infrastructure of your ministry, then we can welcome the code you have imported from them.
Waw, this topic is very nice! Thank you very much! Thank you 1540!
I thank you for these comments about Argan. I hope to meet people who know how to market Argan oil because I run a cooperative active in this field. I would like to market the product. If anyone needs me, you can reply.
Unemployment is a very serious problem. If not tackled, this will lead to catastrophes.
I am looking for work but the best thing is to have a private business. I have money but I don't know the appropriate sector. I am 23. Please help me find a suitable project.
I am a married young girl and I am looking for a job. I hope to get your attention to give a job opportunity to help my husband with household expenses. Thank you. I rely on God.
Excuse me brother, there is no talking with Jews anymore.
I want a job.
Salam. There is no work in Morocco, people.
Greetings. My name is Anir. I have talent in Amazigh films. I ask help of anyone who wants to help me.
I am a young girl, 25. I am looking for a job. I have a BA in law.
Please suggest some solutions to the deterioration of the forest ecosystem.
Congratulations.
Everything is fine brothers!
For me, the state bears responsibility this year because we haven't studied anything. Over 60 hours of strike. If failing rate is high this year, it will bear its responsibility. The week they have added of courses is not enough even for lessons, let alone practical exercises. Anyway, the national exam was difficult for us. We haven't studied anything. Ministers teach their sons abroad and we are fooled in the country and they scare us. Finally, the ministry of national education must certainly bear responsibility.
We refer you to God! You consider people like cows, you trade in them, the way of cowboys! Hhhh, may God take revenge on you!
I would like to set up my own business in the field of wood carpentry. Is it possible for the state to help me?
This is associated with the police and it is interesting. We wish success to security officers. I wish to become a police officer God willing.
Salam. I am looking for the address of the association Lala Salma to fight cancer. It is urgent. Help me please.
God bless you, I love Naima Samih to death.
I have a diploma of office management secretary. I want a job. I need it.
I agree about a former law that Libyans don't like.
Salam alikum. I have been to all Anapec agencies in Morocco. They are all the same. They do nothing. Now I am working and looking for a job.
Is it possible to enter the political life in Libya?
Our society has always been open and has achieved many gains in terms of individual and women rights. This act committed by these people is barbarous. It is not associated in any way with Islam. Everyone should condemn it. It touches everyone. As I don't accept such acts for my sister, wife or any of my relatives, I don't accept it for this girl as well. Finally, it is the duty of the government, security and civil society.
Salam how are you I'm Kawtar from Meknes I like the hip hop even if i don't know understand much about it and I like the group Ach Kayan and I tell them God bless you
Saif Al Islam and leader Kadhafi are a loss for Arabism, may God rest their souls. Shame on Libyans traitors!
I love the songs of Younes Migri especially his song Lili Tawil. I wish this singer success in his musical career. god grants success.
Hi how are you, I'm Hafssa, I'm very happy with this site and this is my hobby to design clothes, I've organized once an exposition and hope to know more designers this is my msn.
This is something really great.
I am Jamila from the town of Alatyfom Berkane. Moroccan traditional dresses are great. I love so much the Moroccan Kaftan. God bless you.
By God, I am very happy with these models. Morocco is the country of culture and fashion. A very nice and ancient country. I saw these nice models, I liked the Moroccan traditional dresses so much and I am proud of being Moroccan. With the will of God, I will join a school for teaching the design of traditional and modern Moroccan dresses. And with the will of God, I will be honoured to join your family which bears the spirit of nationalism and with the will of God I hope you will support me and wish me good luck. May God protect you. Go ahead, with the will of God.
Hi, I am Lamia. I am very happy with site. Would it be possible to add studies on modern and traditional dress design? Thank you.
Where would you take them o mean marionettes, abababab, nothing, ministers usurped millions, take poison, if only you came to teach everyone with 1.
The nicest songs.
Salafists don't scare us and they can't reach us. Tunisia has its own strong men and security to protect it.
Viva Libya! No to America!
There is no other God but God. He is One and has no associate. I witness there is no other God but God and Mohamed is the messenger of God. God is the greatest!
If you go to an African country, accept, pretend to accept or leave the country.
I would like to enroll in the academy.
May God bless martyrs and curse enemies!
They are mocking the Moroccan people. It is all usury.
Salam. My name is Brahim. I am 16. Is it possible for me to join the football school? My dream is to become a player. Please help me!
Hajar we want you in spite of that difference which happened. We hope that you shock them a terrible shock. Bye.
Congratulations Hajar for the victory, you deserve all the best and happiness. Congratulations, we wish you nothing but happiness.
I wish you all the best, Saad.
These are just words! I went to get a loan they told me bring four women who have families.
O Lord destroy Jews and Christians, support Islam and Muslims, o Lord! O Lord this is evil!
If the bac wants you, it wants you, if it doesn't want you it doesn't- even if you're with your father, and the witty should understand.
I am Khalid from Oujda Morocco. I am looking for a job as a public servant but they asked me for 2 million. I am Moroccan, is this true?
I am from Morocco. Honestly, I watch a lot of Algerian TV. But I see that it is a little substandard on the technical level. I ask my Algerian brothers to view Moroccan channels such as 2M, Al Maghribia, Arridia and Al Oula and they will understand what I mean. I have a question. Do Algerians watch Moroccan channels? I want to know whether in Tlemcen people can receive Al Oula channel. I need so much to know. Your Moroccan brother.
I am proud of this law.
The Peace of God be upon you. We have to seek the truth before judging her.
If you see a vice, you should change it. Of course, this is a vice because the life of this girl who committed suicide is our responsibility because Moroccan society looks down on the raped girl. This is the reason that pushed this young girl to think of suicide. Therefore, we should give all girls love to make them interact with society. From this comment, I address a message to all young girls. Don't force yourselves to commit such sin which is unforgiveable by God. My greetings to managers of this site.
Is it possible to have a topic about underage maids? A full topic with an introduction, exposition and conclusion. Thank you for your great efforts.
Salam Ghani. I like so much all your songs and your taste is very nice. You sing with so much feeling. I wish you success in your artistic and marital life. Congratulations firstly wish you a prosperous life God willing!
Salam. I am from Ouarzazate. I salute Ghani and tell him we will always love him.
Salam. I want information. I have a project of opening a carpentry workshop and I need carpentry machines.
I am a Moroccan man. I want to set up a business to build a modern Morocco. Is it possible to help me?
I am a young man from Guelmim. I want to set up a small project in plastics. Is there any help?
I have a business management certificate; I want you to help me.
I am a young woman, 34. I work in handicraft. I need your financial help for my project. I hope to find help. Thank you.
Salam. Let's be honest. In my opinion, Badou Zaki is the one who can achieve victory for the Moroccan national team. However, the federation should not interfere with his decisions. As for the problem which hinders Morocco from winning and making efforts, it is not the coach. The problem lies with the federation and management. Managers in the federation should have wide experience in sport in general and football in particular. Change the federation and you will see the change in the Moroccan team! Thank you!
I would like to know how to register, please.
Salam alikum. I want information about Moukawalati and its programme.
Hi Ghany! I am Laila. I follow all your works. You have always treated us to your wonderful songs. I hope you will present us something new. I hope this will be very soon because I have learnt all your songs by heart. Ok, bye! I hope you read the messages we write you.
God is sufficient for me and He is the best disposer of affairs.
I bear witness that there is no other God but Allah and Mohamed is the messenger of God.
I bear witness that there is no other God but Allah, Mohamed is the messenger of God.
Peace be upon our beloved Mohamed, peace and blessings of God be upon him. All of that is just intended to prove that Islam is terrorism, but as we know, we still love our prophet and the Qur'an is our arm to fight them. O Lord confer your peace and blessings upon our beloved Mohamed. We will sacrifice ourselves for you O messenger of God.
Victory against them will be very soon, these are the signs of the Hour (Judgment Day).
I love Badro and Ahmad so much. They're dear to me- it's a pity Badro left, but Ahmad will be the star inchallah.... Saida from Safi, Morocco
Hi, I'm Imane from Casablanaca, I love Badrou so much and I like him, and it's him who deserves to be the star but I don't understand one thing, Badrou has his public and at the end he dropped out, why.
How are you, Hi I'm Houdayfa from Morocco, the town of Tifelt, you were great in Maghreb star academy and you sing well, hope is lost Badrou, it's over bye.
Hi to all the star academy, this is a nice program which has achieved great success in the Arab Maghreb so that they'll stay united, I wish success to Hajar and Hamid who will be the nominee
Salam, how are you? I don't accept this presentation. Thank you!
Nothing of that in reality.
Congratulations my brother. She is really lucky to have you.
Congratulations and may God assist you in coming games God willing, oh Lord. I hope from God, even if my country Morocco didn't win, that you will make us happy. May God assist you.
Hi, how are you? I thank you for this nice site. I tell you that athletics are beyond the reach of Moroccans. Athletics require a state in which there is no robbery, falsification, doping drugs and lies. What can I tell you, my brothers? Run until God grants you help. Bye.
A man and master of men.
Bin Laden is a Mujahid, may God protect you.
This is impossible because policy didn't authorise all this and that.
Honestly, this is not logical. I want the address of an aesthetic surgeon in Casablanca, please, save me.
A great greeting to you Hajar, you're the star of the academy, Soukaina, Morocco
Salam alikum. We cannot discuss this topic because the Algerian police is practising terrorism against the people.
My greetings to the Justice and Development party.
Salam alikum. I want the addresses of clinics in Casablanca to cure drug addiction to save my cousin. Thank you very much.
Thank you for your efforts!
Salam. I want solutions to drugs as an individual and group. Thank you for the information.
Hi. I am from Morocco. I like rap so much and Techno. In our times, there are many people addicted to this music genre. We like so much Bigg because he talks about things present in our country. A kiss from me to all the people who sing the rap especially to you Bigg and all the people who deeply tackle this sector. Bye.
The first thing is salam alikum. I would like to say that I like all Moroccan bands but Bigg is incomparable. I like his words because he says something logical. Thank you.
I love Cheb Bilal so much. I listen to his old songs 1985 because he is a great artist who has great talents. I hope he will return to his old art. Moufake Bilal July 13, 1966. Thank you.
It is textile sector which is the source of living for a quarter of Moroccan people especially the poorest class. For example, in the sector of mattresses, in the industrial zone, all girls go out at 8. Everyone has a speciality but mainly sewing. If firms begin to close down, go bankrupt, and girls begin leaving work, there will be an economic crisis. In 2009, this will be confirmed. Therefore, since it is not late, the state must help employers in order to solve this problem and so that graduate people won't be lost. If they remain jobless, it will be a catastrophe. People have made loans, have families for whom they care for, and they have kids. We were all be lost ok, may God bring the good. Thank you.
I think that elections are based on bribery and money. Officials are aware of this issue. Where is democracy you are chanting? You are like kids, you ask about voters apathy for elections.
Rap music is Moroccan. There is no need to talk about it. Honestly, no other Arab nation is like us.
I am looking for a job in a construction company or business. I am a building work site supervisor. I have worked in this field for 24 years. I am ready to work anywhere.
Dawdi is your master. Long live Morocco forever.

a strictly subjective channel!
The people want Zaki.
Ahmed, 33, father of two kids from Oujda. I am looking for a job of any type.
What is this? You always look the same. There is no power and no will but from God.
I love all those who love Nasro I don't say that Nasro can be called a master, like the sister who talked about later Hasni, if he were still alive he would have ruled all the Arab Maghreb because in six years he sung on all 2007 Hasni king of the Rai succeded by his student, if he was still here he would have been the knig
Ziani and Djabour are the best. We are behind you Saadane, the national team will tell you.
Long live Nasro. You are in our hearts and blood. I wish you success in your life!
Hi my brothers. What can I tell you; there is nothing left I can say. Everything is over.
Salam, how are you? I want to ask, if you don't mind, why don't you do something that will profit the creatures of God? ok
Bless you Tunisians!
Enough!
I want Hassan El Fad in a one-man show!
I love Alloudi to death.
For the brother, there is nothing. If you get the baccalaureate with a 10 grade, just go and do what you said you will do. Because in this country, you should take the baccalaureate with a 14 grade and more. Otherwise, you should find someone to pay for you a private school. But if only they could find solutions for us to study and teachers to explain to us. By God we would have received more than 14. This year I haven't studied English and I don't even know what it is about. So I said to myself that I would try to study it alone but I nearly got mad.
Hi everyone, I want to say that I don't agree with you because unemployment in Morocco is always on the rise, I hope that that it
Oh Lord grant success to everyone.
I am a student from Meknes. I say as a student that there are no more good studies in this Morocco. They pass just by cheating without lying to God. Everyone knows the cheating that goes on during the day of the exam. May God guide everyone. Salam alaikum.
Present us Titanic.
I am with water.
Raja forever, forever to death. WAC no, no, no. Raja forever.
I am a Wydad fan to death. Wydad forever! Wydad forever, red nation to death! I am a free Wydad fan and like it. Wydad forever! God + parents + Wydad!
Salam. Wydad forever, Wydad forever! Wydad to death! Red forever, to death! Death to locusts!
Everyone is Widadi! Anyone who says no should come to me! Raja is a Chinese good! Hhhh!
I am a fan of this artist, not in his personal life, but in his art and singing. I liked him even more when he sang with the group Bleu. It is a smart group, noisy!
Wydad forever.
I'm Karima from Tangier I encourage the students of star ac...and I vote for Dounia. Dounia. Dounia
Street by street, hahaha, son of streets!
By God, we love peace in Algeria and in all Islamic countries. God willing, it will spread, thanks to the efforts of our president, Abdelaziz Bouteflika, and his strong army. But you have destroyed my future with these decisions. I was about to marry, but you took him to the Sahara near the borders for two years. You have broken my hope and my heart. You took me to a station without exit. Anyway, thanks to God for everything. Thank you!
I am a student in the common trunk school. I would like to specialize in mathematics. What should I do? I want a reply please! Is it possible for me to specialize this subject from the common trunk?
What is the score we need to go to a good school after the baccalaureate.
I am married to a girl through my mother. We do not have kids yet. I want to divorce. Is there a solution? How much money do I need?
If a man and woman divorce, is it the woman or man who should take the house or both of them? By the way, the house is in the name of the man.
I am a Moroccan woman. I live in Italy. I have serious problems with my husband.
I am a young man, 34. I am married but we don't understand each other.
Salam. Thank you for this advice. I wish success to the sisters.
My husband wants to take a second wife without my approval. I am confused. He has not yet divorced me. He left me, I am neither married or divorced.
I have been married for three months. Now I want to divorce because he is sterile. I don't live a happy life with him. He lives in Spain and I live with his mother. I didn't want to marry him but my family insisted that I marry him. Now do I ask for divorce? This is not possible because there are no sufficient reasons or Haram to divorce him.
Salam alikum. I had been married for six years and have two kids. The older is 7 and the younger is 3. I divorced in 2007. This is not the problem. The problem is that I am far from my children in terms of distance. I live 460 km away. I have to visit them every week. This is very exhausting. In holidays, my son says please dad tell Mum to let us come on the day of Eid. I asked her but she refused. If the family code serves the interests of the child, so where is his interest if his simplest requests are rejected by his mother? By the way I cover all their needs including alimony and moral needs. I visit them every week. I ask anyone informed about the topic to advise me because not all men deserve what women do.
I am a Moroccan woman. I would like to ask about alimony and Moutaa for a divorced woman. Thank you!
The woman should also be decent and not wear indecent clothes in that way that's all.
I call upon every Moroccan to stay in his homeland.
Hi everyone! In my opinion, if they remained in Morocco, they would be educated better. But they won't be well-educated abroad, OK? But if their parents are also Moroccans, they will be educated. But if their parents aren't Moroccans, they won't be educated, OK?
Long live Badro and Farid Djamel
I love Morocco's star academy but jurisprudence and Islam say that singing is forbidden and that they will be severely punished. Why don't they make something like star academy but not a star academy of singing, of reciting God's Qu'ran, be He glorified, God is great, God is great, God is great.
I love you Hajar and my friend Jamal. Let's not forget Khayri!
Salam. I say to the Libyan people, go back to your houses. Kadhafi is not an agent or traitor. Kadhafi is a righteous man. What I like about him is that he says a word of truth.
Bravoooo! You're men of the book!
Salam alaikoum, by God I can't find the words to thank our master Amar Ezzahi, may God protect him inchallah.
Nass Elghiwane are among the best and most talented groups in Morocco, in addition to Larsad, Essiham and Jilala as well as Lemchahhab. I mean as Moroccans we must be proud of them the best thing is that they pick their lyrics from the everyday street life of the Moroccans. I thank them all.
We want the starac to be 24 and the clothes of the students better, we encourage all the sons of my country 123 long live Algeria
Hi, how are you, my greetings to all the star academy I wish success to Hajar, Hamid and all the contestants
I want to ask Hajar why did she vote for Dounia, I love Jamal, and Jamal is better than Dounia, and the academy without Jamal is useless, you see at the beginning you've dropped out Kaoutar and we said there's no problem, but to take out the best voice which is Jamal nnnnnnnnnnnnn we don't want that now I hate Hajar even if I'm from Morocco but I love Jamal
I also want to study in technological training. I am from Fnideq.
Zairi I want to tell you you're great in your play we like your performance. You deserve to play with BARCA or REAL.
Salam. Blessed Ramadan! I hope you will rebroadcast programmes of Assaidsa magazine with the topic of distributing books in the port of Tangier.
A very nice topic, thank you, please publish other topics.
Peace and mercy of God be upon you.
Hi, how are you? How are you holding up with Ramadan? I thank you so much for this initiative. Television programmes can help bring peace and solidarity with Muslims.
I want to play with Barcelona, come on!
I am from Ghardimou. I love it so much. It is always nice in the summer or Ramadan. If you come here, you will see this because we, its residents, are kind people and known for our hospitality, ok. I die for it!
Salam. I am Mohamed Bouazzati from Nador. I would like to contribute because I know how to play. However, Tangier is far away. Who will take care of me there? Reply to my, this email is my facebook.
This is an injustice.
How are you? You are very good! Thank you! You have honoured us!
Algeria, God willing, will crush Egypt. We have men not cheap like Egyptians. We die for our dignity. God willing we will win and go to the world cup and CAF. One, two, three long live Algeria. With you Algeria, Greens will achieve good results.
1, 2, 3 long live Algeria. God willing, we will go to the world cup and even to the semis.
Long live my country. God willing we will go to the world cup against the will of Egyptians.
Hi all. The conference on industrial strategy in Algeria begins this week. At first sight, it is a good thing to think about means that unfortunately come too late, but it will help Algeria to get back on track. We sometimes hear leaders that went through former eras and took part in setting up an industrial strategy in Algeria in the 70s claim that they made mistakes, but they are the ones who plan on setting up this new 2000 strategy. Who knows whether they wont make mistakes again, they will miss a lot, as mistake is human. But the hardest part is that these people forget to mobilize society for a project that is at its own benefit. Another thing is that university as a promoter of national economy wont be present at this conference, whereas it will be the driving force of development and innovation in co-operation with other national and foreign partners. This is how things go in countries who wish to foster their economy in the after-oil era. I wish good luck to all those thinkers who will draw up the outlines of Algerian economy after this oil boost. Long live Algeria.
Thank you very much.
A great opportunity against Casa.
I love the FAR team and wish them good luck in football 2007/2008.
Mehdi deserves everything. God willing, he will soon be a world champion in his career. My heart and my God protect him!
Thank you Nasro for the song "Suffering nights" in addition to this one "I Amel your love", no matter what happens, Amel is my life, she did me something which I regret, I am familiar with her but she didn't understand me. Thank you Nasro, king of the sentimental song.
Salam alikoum. You have mixed up and confused everything between Star Academy Lebanon and Star Academy Maghreb. Anyway, Star Academy Maghreb is much better than the Star Academy Lebanon because they are not so scandalous and shameless. I will give you a small example, just from Morocco's Asmae. By God she is brazen. I don't know whether she has gone to become a singer or if she has gone to marry. Bye.
How are you Diaa, you are the most beautiful in the star and hope that it will be you and Saad a star. Transmit my greetings to Nadre and Mostafa.
Tunisia is better than Morocco in management. But Morocco and its resources are better than Tunisia.
I don't want to express my opinion about this topic because I know nothing about it. The only thing I know well is that the Sahara has been for a long time and is still and will be Moroccan. No one will thwart us from taking it ahead (please send me some information about this fabricated dispute and I will be grateful to your site).
Salam alaikoum sisters and brothers. What is this rubbish? I take refuge in God, we want to make progress in terms of belief, faithfulness, good worship and abidance by religious rules. We are part of an Islamic nation and the nation of the dear Prophet. Why this rubbish, why? We aren't Jews or Christians who need to ask people for a place to sing. Where are you Muslims? where are you nation of Mohamed? Where, where, where, where? There is no power and no will but from God Almighty.
I love Star Academy Maghreb but it is not as developed as in Lebanon. There should be nice primes and nice pictures. Moreover, there should be a presenter who makes you love StarAc, not like that one.
Thank you very much RAJA.
I am interested in this field. Therefore, I want to learn traditional dressmaking.
Raja forever, forever.
We thank you so much as you celebrated our Tachlhit, and it's broadcast on TV as well, but we want to have our own channel. Best greetings to you with wishes of happiness and well-being.
I am crazy for Moroccan Caftan and Tkchita. Therefore, I ask people who are interested in this field not to be influenced by western cultures in our traditions and customs.
I would like to learn how to make sfifa if possible. May God reward you with all the good!
We want more of Moroccan dresses, many designs and preserving their authenticity. Thank you!
I have been trying to call this number but in vain, why?
I don't have a comment. I am a young girl, 26. I have previously married but then I divorced from my husband for family problems. Then I met a young man who promised to marry me especially when he learnt that I was divorced I was like a prey for him. Now I am pregnant in the seventh month. I ask someone to help me.
Salam. I am Souad from Agadir. I die for football. I hope to become a player in the national team and Raja. However, I don't like women league in Morocco. No one takes care of it and they don't air it on TV like men league.
The best player in the world is Messiiii!
Peace, mercy and blessings of God be upon you. First of all, I am very happy because you have accepted my comment and posted it. Best wishes to you!
Zaki forever, we don't need Trosi or Ichil we want the coach of the country. Another thing, for those who aren't specialists in football (the people of the federation) they should leave it and let players.
Hamidouuuu I love you so much, I'm crazy for you my love.
Many congratulations, Antar Yahia! Wishing the same to the others! God willing, God will grant your wishes and happiness!
Congratulations to all the Ziani and Antar family, God willing, we wish them happiness! Many congratulations Yahia and sister of Ziani (unfortunately, I don't know her name)!
Thank you, but I want to know if it's possible to know the date of the world day of this disease.
Long live Moroccan cipes and well done Hajji, you're a good player you and all other players.
Morocco forever long live Morocco and WAC forever+Morocco Moroccan forever and always proud of Morocco. I wish success to the lions forever and Myaghri is ours.
The best singer on the world level whom I love is Saida Fikri. I love so much Saida.
I like all candidates of Maghreb star academy, Abdelhamid and Hajar you have to work hard because in the end you'll get the right thing
Good, very good.
If the heart were to love two no one of us would have been at rest.
Good- this site is great and I encourage you so much.
Beautiful site really
Where are the answers?
Peace, brother Nasro. By God my brother, I miss you so much. I also miss your nice voice. How are you? How is the sweet Fatima? I hope to see you soon, God willing. My greetings to our brother Mourad, Cheikh Naam and all our brothers. Your brother Badr from Nador.
Salam alikum. In the name of God. I would like you to post the news of the amateur championship, latest news on the first page, for example the results of Youssoufia.
Saida is the nicest singer in Morocco, with her heritage; she remains the singer of the country. May God grant her long life.
I'm a teacher and like everything you do.
I'm a young Moroccan girl. I'm happy with this Maghreb achievement. Anyway, I have one comment. As we are still studying and I'm a fan of the long jump, I hope that you explain the rules of this event better, so that you make it known to we enthusiasts to do the same branch. Thank you for this and I hope you will answer my request.
God bless you, that's all. You have the Moroccan spirit and you are a flower with that great voice.
Now we're just talking. I have seen many questions without any replies. They are missing. We are wasting our time. I wanted to ask you a question but I know my question will remain without an answer. Anyway, God will help us! I hope there will be a change. By God, we're really tired! We prayed God to pass, but now that we have passed, we did nothing with it! Very odd!
Many congratulations Nadoura for the star, by God you deserve it.
Good evening! I am a student. I passed the baccalaureate with honours. But what is next? Stay home or go to law school? I preferred a private school which has many features and offers many subjects. But I hail from a poor family that can't afford this. Praise be to God! Thank you!
Since the conflict between Morocco and Algeria is in a stalemate, Sahara has to be divided in half. So people can choose to go to Morocco or Algeria then they will demarcate the border between them.
What is this? God is the greatest! We all support the messenger.
We don't accept in any way those who offend our dear prophet Mohamed! God's curse on them!
Viva the Tunisian revolution! May God protect the Tunisian people!
My brother Farouk, are you sick? Are you aware about what you are saying? Yes, live and enjoy your life because you have nothing to do. But don't forget you are nothing. You are like an animal. You won't achieve anything. Moreover, one day will come when you fall and regret it. No situation stays the same forever! People like you deserve to be beheaded or what do you say?
Shame on you! May God punish them with a severe punishment! God suffices me and He is the best mandate!
There is no other God but God. Muslim forever.
Salam. I will sit for the baccalaureate this year 2011. Pray for me God to grant me success may God reward you with good!
I hope the exam of 2011 will run smoothly. Oh Lord grant us success because this year is a little difficult.
Salam. I am a student in the second year of the baccalaureate human sciences. God willing, after passing the baccalaureate I would like to study in ISTA. I would like to know available subjects. Thank you!
Azul. Salam. My greetings to Mr Zaki. My God honour you. Without you, they have never found a solution to this impasse. They are aware of this. However as it is said, as long as you're in Morocco don't be surprised. But you Zaki are loved by people. What they give you is futile. They want a salary with bonuses and return tickets to mix up things. This is what they want because they don't care about results. Ok, we hope they will turn the page may be the situation changes. Zaki forever, to death.
I wish good luck to the national team.
The coach is close to us we hope someone will understand us.
I am a Moroccan citizen. I love our national team. I ask officials in the federation to leave them in peace. They have ruined us. We want Bado Zaki and an official who previously played football in the federation. I want the press to make a fuss so that officials will resign. Thank you.
I hope that Bado Zaki returns to the national team in order to restore the fighting spirit for the national jersey.
In the name of God the Beneficent the Merciful. I prefer a Moroccan coach even if Badou Zaki isn't the leading coach. I ask God the Almighty that the coach will be Moroccan. I hope that the Moroccan Federation will quickly take a decision as soon as possible. Peace, mercy and blessings of God be upon you.
I hope that Badou Zaki returns to the national team because he loves Morocco but the federation is against him. Morocco is odd.
Salam alikum. As long as Badou Zaki isn't in the national team, our national team will always remain quasi nil.
Such projects make society progress. People want more. my greetings.
Peace be upon everyone who visits this site. First of all, enough scandals and humiliations. The teams we used to defeat with high scores now we find difficulties with them. The cause is known by all Moroccans. It is the intervention of people who aren't associated with football. Does these people not have a conscience to reprimand them? Do they have no concern for their country? We understand nothing by God. They interfere with the line-up of the team, they spend a lot of money but the results are always scandalous and defeats even at home. I hope this new team will be a turning point and the beginning of a new era for the Moroccan football and renewed confidence in local officers.
Salam.I am an unemployed university graduate. I have been working for a while in the field of computer graphics. I had an idea about it and I learnt a lot of things in this field. Since there is no job, I hope to set up a small business like this. However, I don't have financial resources. Can funders of Moukawaalti help me? Please, if you have any idea advise me, thank you!
Laroussa is a wide agricultural area but lacks many things. We welcome Hamadi Jebali and the minister of agriculture. We want to welcome you with thanks.
Hello my name is Desdery Kuzenza. I'm a manager of YANGEYANGE ARTS GROUP from DODOMA-TANZANIA. My group plays African traditional music mainly from the central part of our country. We have experience in participating in different festivals inside and outside the country. Should you please let us know if there is a chance for our three musicians to perform in your festival this year? Hope to hear from you soon.
I am an oppressed and imprisoned. I want the free phone number to get help, may God protect you. I am oscillating between life and death with this husband. I ask you, by God to help me and give me your free phone number for divorce.
This is a sign of the Hour, the sedition of woman has appeared!
The minimum wage should be lifted for workers in local communes to reach 4000 dirhams to ensure a dignified living.
Salam alikum. I am Fatah from Casa. I have a problem which I can't talk about to my family. I was the victim of rape. I want an association in Casa.
Salam alikum. Do you think brothers that this increase will be without counterpart? People are still mistaken. They will increase salaries but there will be a counterpart. The costs of living will rise. Imagine that the price of an oil battle has increased from 5 dirhams to 12 dirhams. This is just an example. God suffices me and He is the best mandate!
All women in Morocco should adopt the same opinion, unite hands, support themselves by themselves and claim their rights through associations or protests in order to change conditions. They must be one hand in order to achieve their claims. Thank you.
M. Achraf Abron, the president of the century, President forever.
Salam alikum. I haven't yet understood anything. Tell me about this Moukawalati so that I know if you help people to be alright in this life. Looking forward to your reply. Salam alikum.
I wish success to all Muslims.
I wish good luck to anyone who will sit for the exams.
Why do you lose hope?
My dream is to get the baccalaureate degree.
It is easy to put the blame for the results of our mistakes on other people. However, it is difficult to say that we are wrong towards ourselves. I was always one of the top students. But when I went to high school, I became one of the lazy students. Now I regret everything because I wanted to sit for the baccalaureate although I wasn't ready for this. The reason is that there are no other people. So stop blaming others who have nothing to do with our studies. Thank you!
We hope that the minister understands that this is beyond our means.
Read this topic, it is good.
Mounsif. I talk about the Moroccan traffic code. I say succinctly to the minister Mr Karim, before implementing your code, you should first consider the state of roads; the attitude of the police towards citizens and the mentality of the people. There is no power and no will but from God.
I would like to know at what age cancer begins. Please reply!
Education, sir, is everything. If there is no education, accidents will continue. If they want to eliminate them from the country, OK, there's nothing worse than chaos. I told you.
May Allah have mercy on your soul, oh Ahmed, my dear.
Salam. If you want to marry via the internet, the other is rarely a friend.
Salam alikum my brothers. The best thing in all these topics is good intentions and seriousness. Girls wish to marry today. There is no harm in this. This is not illegitimate. This meeting forum is also nice. However, if anyone is seeking a serious relationship, he should be sincere not once he has the opportunity, he deceives all the girls who trusted him. My name is Nadia from Casa. I would like to meet friends, both girls and boys. May God grant success to everyone!
A proverb says 'no one marries on the street'. So one shouldn't deceive people or this is the easiest way to lie to each other. God has not recommended this. Remember God a little, may be this is better.
I entered the site at random and I liked this. I myself have a problem of the inflation of the breast which prevents me from going to the beach and Hammam like other people. I am afraid unless people would laugh at me. I think of the operation of liposuction but I heard that the operation causes serious damage. What are these damages and does it cause death and how much does this operation cost and whether it is available in Casa.
Hadj Aissa is the best in words and practise, not Zaha Stif, ok Zaha is good. Algeria is everywhere for those who love us but let those who hate us listen, best Arab player and the world cup Hadj.
I am a Moroccan young man. I live in Spain and Italy. I am an entrepreneur in these two countries. Concerning marriage with a foreigner, I think it is a big mistake. One of the main problems is lack of respect for national identity. The second problem is non respect for the orders of Islamic religion. The responsibility for these problems lies with the Moroccan government because it is weak. This is the truth. Salam alikum.
Hajar, by God, I haven't watched since they told me that you weren't present. I love you to death, don't worry- money comes and goes.
Long live Hajar, God bless you the daughter of my country and my city, the Sahara is Moroccan. I'm crazy for you Hajar even if you were near me but at the same time far away.
Bring back Zaki. Stop scandals, poor performance and jealousy you jealous members in the federation. Bring him to save us. May God curse you, you have disgraced us. It is not a frog and it has not cried. Do we have football or ****? Save us Zaki, save us just for our sake. Zaki, Zaki, Zaki, Zaki, Zaki.
Hi. I liked this article.
We are students and sometimes we're not sure about the right subjects to choose. There are not expert staff members to help us. Therefore, we ask you, sir, to adopt an adequate solution, because the education policy is deteriorating. As a brother said previously, it is one of the worst education policies.
I am a student in the Tronc Commun Scientifique, I would like to study economic sciences but I fear that I am not accepted.
Unacceptable, unacceptable, unacceptable.
This year I will sit for the baccalaureate in physical sciences. I had 14.67 in the regional exam and the first GPA in the class exam this year, 17.52, but I have one problem. I wear hijab; the school won't accept me with hijab.
Shame on those who did this!
Salam alikum. Thank you for this article.
May God rest his soul and grant patience to his parents.
Peace and mercy of God be upon you. Anyway I tell you may God rest his soul and forgive him. May God guide today's young people, they follow Belqas on the road. Anyway, it is destiny. May God rest his soul and rest the souls of all Muslims.
Nothing to say. Our condolences to the family of Belqas. But this is normal, they were drunken, others as well and the girl who was with them. Of course this is normal. Anyway, may God forgive him.
Eh look my brother, this is life. Just be patient and God will rest his soul, God willing.
Good film, God bless its directors.
Look brothers, this is a terrific film. My favourite film is Ali Zaoua. I thank these cartoon directors for this film. There are some movies in which directors are just messing up I prefer they would go to graze sheep.
This film is nice, not bad.
Mosaique I love you so much!
Salam. I am a Moroccan citizen in Germany. I would like to benefit from micro-loans in Morocco in order to set up a small project. How can I benefit? Please inform me. Thank you.
We will win the game against Cameroon.
I am Kawtare from Tangier. Thank you very much for this site, because it's nice. I want the msn of fashion designers. Thank you!
Thank you very much!
God suffices us and He is the best mandate against those who tarnished our reputation. We Moroccans will remain the best example of security and tolerance.
There is no comment. Everyone wears what he likes.
Hi! Is it possible to get the latest models of Kaftans? Thank you for the site!
First of all, blessed and happy Ramadan everyone. Wish you wellness and happiness. Thank you for publishing our comments! I like Moroccan Caftan and hope it will be admired by all countries. God bless you!
This is a nice thing.
Salam alikum. Happy Eid everyone! I like so much Moroccan dresses. Thank you!
Salam. Blessed Ramadan and happy New Year! I am Bouchra. Is it possible to show the latest designs for veiled women if you don't mind? Thank you for your programme! Wish you success!
Salam. My name is Yasmin. I am 20. I was born in Brussels, Belgium. I hope that you Moroccans put hand in hand, co-operate all to overcome the crisis of unemployment. Our country is deteriorating and dropping backward. I hope that senior robbers in this country will have some consideration, have some shame and think of the people as well. They shouldn't rob everything that comes under their hands. Anyway, I would like to tell you my brothers is that we should put hand in hand, lift the flag of our country. Although I was born in Belgium, my country is my country. I am ready to sacrifice my life for the sons of my country. I hope that you have understood me especially the people I am referring to, wake up, enough robbery!
Bilal, Bilal, forever!
Hi, good evening, I'm very glad today, I love so much all the songs of Younes Migri and I'm one of the fans of Younes Migri; in fact he is a nice person, he talks frankly in his songs and I wish him a successful career in his life and wish him success. In fact I also like his films and to say the truth I like to hear new things about him and very happy for him. Good luck.
The best singer and artist in the world is Younes Migri, I'm one of the fans of Younes Migri, I talked to him and he's very nice and listens to his fans, and his face and the best proof of his good manners, long life to him!
I love you so much Hajar. I am very happy for your success and your new song "La, la, la Tkol Ayit" 5no, no, don't say I am tired).
Big, your songs are great, I wish you success to you and all Arab singers, with wishes of success inchallah.
I love Bigg's songs so much, keep things up to par and don't forget to make a disc about Dokala Aabda.
Before you insult Bigg, look at yourself. At least he did something for his country, unlike you.
Eh Big, you're mentally sick. It is better do sports instead of singing in order to lose weight, people aren't the same.
It is not normal that some don't like Bigg. Pride to Bigg, something new. You must first ask to listen to him then judge him.
Bigg you're great, by God, so so much, take care of yourself. This is a great interview, by God.
Salam alikum. I love Hajar. The first thing that can be said about her is that she is beautiful, hard-working, a family girl and then a star. I wish her all the good.
I want to work if you don't mind.
I want to know the latest news of the champion Badr Hari.
We want you to present us topics about monuments of the city of Fes in fifteen minutes.
I want to set up a construction firm. Is there any help out there, even just moral support? Thank you.
I am Wahiba. I love Ghani. I love you so much!
Shame on you! The world is uniting and we are divided.
I want a loan from Zagora institute of 3,000 dirhams. What are the conditions?
Salam alikum. I have a diploma in poly-cultures and animal production. I want a loan to start a project in the field of agriculture, for example, becoming a merchant of agricultural drugs or breeding cows. Salam.
Salam. I'm happy to address your respectable association and hoping that you'll help me in setting up a small business in agriculture. I have a diploma in this field. I am a young Moroccan man who lives in Spain. Sincerely yours. Aziz, the friend of everyone.
I want information about your loan.
I'm a young Moroccan man of 24, unemployed, from the region of Feguig Bouanane. I want a loan to set up a project in agriculture.
Salam. I am Hajar from the city of Fès. I have the idea of a project. I want financial help.
Salam alikum. I am a young man from the city of Errachidia. I ask your help to set up a business specialized in assembling tiles. Thank you!
God is sufficient for me and He is the best disposer of affairs against anyone who tries to distort the image of our prophet, our religion and honour. God is the greatest!
No to rape!
The disbelievers in God! They found only the messenger of God, peace and blessings be upon him! I witness there is no other God but Allah and Mohamed is the messenger of God.
I ask God's forgiveness.
Tamazight is our language.

Long live Ahmed and Soraya- Ahmed is from Morocco. nador
I congratulate all the youth of Star Academy and wish them success, namely abd elhamid from Morocco
We are with you o messenger of God! Shame on them. This is not just. Dogs are barking but the message will be communicated God willing!
Salam alikum. First of all, I like this site as we need so much from it. I am Anisa. I have a diploma in word processing and I don't know what is the suitable job for me with you. Please help me!
This is good. This means that you provide more news than 2M. In addition to news, you can present articles which cover advice in all fields!!!
Super, God bless you.
There should be a very strong relationship within the Maghreb union, thank you.
One says people will live a happy life! This makes me laugh! Are you happy with this life we Muslims, as we allege to say, are living? As for Muslims just by name, there is nakedness, debauchery, hypocrisy and pretending to be religious in articles, TV stations and other similar outlets. Anyway, you are living what you are alleging. As for Ben Laden and Moujahids who are with him, they are real Muslims. As for your opinions, you're just pretending. One is talking about humanity, values and says he has studied religion, hhhh! They are of no use! They should be executed! When you talk to them, you find out that animals are better than them. As for our time, there is no abidance by religion or denomination, just smelling the flavor, following the west. Who protects religions, licentious like you, presidents of states, ministers or those who live in luxury who don't feel salt coming out from the mouth! We want peace not Muslims like him! In life, they just seek to live in happiness, felicity and rest on the right site although he bears the responsibility for millions. It is not important, they just want to live and enjoy life! Is this religion you're talking about? The ones you call infidel must begin with Arabs first then westerners. At least westerners hold on to their religion. As for Arabs, they're not happy with their religion. Enough, animals! You're illiterate in dialog, you can't understand!
Salam. First of all, Oussama ben Laden is the leader of Islam. Rights of Muslims are in Qur'an. May God protect you my brother Oussama! We will implement Qur'an and Islamic sharia forever.
Bassma, we love you so much. Good luck. Give a kiss to Yahya.
From God we are and to God shall we return!
They distorted the image of Moroccans, by God this is a shame.
It is better you didn't win Bassma because you have disgraced Moroccans **** may God curse those who educated her, she disgraced us.
We are with you throughout your career to the last day of our lives. There is no other God but Allah, Mohamed is the messenger of God. Oh Lord be witness that I have transmitted!
The word of Muslims is in fragmentation. If you want to confirm this just look at the East compared with the Maghreb.
I am a divorced Moroccan woman. I want to marry an Egyptian man but don't know which are the necessary papers. So please help me.
I don't know who is terrorism maybe those who are sitting on the chair and say Oussama Ben Laden. He is a real Muslim Arabs.
Hi. How are you? I am Ghita from Casablanca. I love you so much Bassma and Khawla. You have honoured Morocco.
I want the address of a plastic surgeon in Casablanca. Thank you.
Salam alikum. I am a young girl. I am 18. I have a scar in my face and this causes me a lot of embarrassment because I am still young and I am a student. Everyone tells me to have a plastic surgery but I don't have money for this. I ask people to help me. Thank you. May God reward every benefactor.
If there are no drugs in Morocco, there will be a chaos.
Salam. I am Widad from Morocco. I want the addresses of some centres which fight drug addiction. I have a brother who is addicted to a drug which is 'silisyoun' (a type of glue). If possible, help me so that he overcomes this phase. It is about 17 years now that he is addicted to it. If possible, I want an address as soon as possible because his condition is deteriorating. Thank you.
Have mercy on those on earth and God will have mercy on you.
Salam. I am a young girl. I am looking for the address of this association which helps single mothers. Thank you!
Slakha Haraga and rely on God, this is all we can do. They have eaten Algeria, they are never satisfied, may God make them eat worms, with the will of God, fire will eat them as they have eaten illegal money.
I'm new to this site.
Hi, I condemn these acts which separate Muslims.
I'm new to this site but I'll always follow it and will send you comments about these topics.
May God punish you with prison, so-called al-Qaeda. Hahaha
I am Mc-m from Sahrawa style of Errachidia. I entered the world of rap with personal conviction but unfortunately we have technical and financial problems.
There is no Bigg or slim, standing up or sitting down or anything else. The free Moroccan is the one who wakes up in the morning, performs his ablutions and pray dawn prayer Mrs Iman.
Fnaire, Fnaire forever.
Salam brothers. I am Fati, a fan of rap. Rap is great; it brings relaxation and happiness. Take a lesson from rap. It talks about psychological and spiritual problems. Long live rap. I love all Moroccan rap music, especially Moinssa. Good luck to all hip hop, non stop. Rap is not dead.
Hi Nessma, I congratulate you for your efforts.
People are staring and you are talking idly. Salafis have done what they want and you still see more. I hope from God I won't stay anymore in Morocco because there is nothing to do. Thank you!
This is the era of backwardness in life. In spite of the religion of Islam and learning Qur'an, people didn't benefit anything. Even in other religions, women wear decent clothes. As for the semi-naked women, they were mentioned in Qur'an, they are present. They are all fitna. Therefore, God the Almighty ordered us to lower our gaze. May God guide daughters of Muslim to respect their bodies and not make of it a cheap merchandise sold in public.
If possible, I am trying to meet this Cheb if you don't mind if you have any way to get in touch with him, send me his email, thank you.
You're really a great artist! We hope to welcome you in Algeria. You're a pure rai man. We call you Younes Castor.
My brother, please sing for me! I die for you, your songs, your way of dressing, style and your voice! May God protect you from the evil eye, protect you for your parents. We want your new works as soon as possible?
What is wrong with you my friend? You think yourself Mami? Go to bed. If you listen to me singing rai you would stop singing. Long live Algerian rai and long live Najim.
Well. I see you Cheb Younes as a flag. I listen to your song. Your voice is similar to the voice of Cheb Khaled. You are famous in Algeria and France. This is the first time we are introduced to the Moroccan Rai singer. Honestly, you are an international artist. From what I know, you are from the border of Algeria, you have the Algerian accent. Good luck Younes.
I love a man but he doesn't love me. My brothers want me to marry another man.
Salam alikum. I have caught the programme 45.00 minutes on 16/8. The topic was marrying underage girls in villages. This is not the main problem. The real problem is that this marriage is concluded just with reading Al Fatiha from Qur'an. The girl is married at the age of 12. She goes to the house of her husband who is barely 14. She doesn't spend over five days in the house of the husband and she comes back to her parents' house with the title of divorced woman. The cause is that the girl is not adapted with the husband and marital life. I feel sorry for the situation of these villages. I asked about causes which make them marry their daughters and found out that poverty, high cost of living, fees to go to the city to officialize marriage. However the only victim of this marriage aren't spouses or their families, it is their children who are born without a marriage contract, they are not registered at the civil status and this causes a huge problem and hurdle in their lives. Honestly, I thought so much and want help to find a solution to these villages. Thanks to everyone who has any solution or anything, I am waiting.
I am 17. I love someone who is 29. He also loves me. We want to marry but my parents refuse. We went to marry but they required the approval of parents for underage girls. I don't know what to do. If you have any solution to my problem, may God reward you with good, please reply as soon as possible! God grants success!
Marriage has become something ordinary in our society especially for girls. They are very young. In my opinion, they just want to build their personal lives without knowing consequences and responsibility of this marriage. Marriage of underage girls is a serious problem.
I want from this sports channel to air matches to the Moroccan fans especially Wydad.
This is senseless about Morocco!
am very impressed with personality that distinguishes you from the rest. Your songs are very romantic I hope you embark on a new album I wish you success.
I want a job.
You are a caricature of singing and a miscreant!
Fear God and repent!
I'm Samia, I'm 14, I love Cheb Nasro, he's the best, I have all his CDs, I love him, may God always protect him for us, oh Lord, Amen, the best song is 'Lima'araf El Hob', bravo Nasro.
Espérance o state!
Supporters' cell in Sidi Alouane always supports Espérance.
The strongest association in the history of Tunisia is Esperance. Everyone knows this, Esperance empire!
Eh Ba Hassan, may God protect you.
The best artist in Morocco, Hassan El Fed, Gad El Maleh of Morocco…
I think that Morocco is experiencing a very difficult period, in terms of education. The ministry of national education sincerely didn't know how to develop education. Instead of improving it, it has complicated it. I don't know the real cause. They don't need so much experience in this field. God grants success to everyone.
Hassan El Fad, I respect your art, but honestly- the way you act is heavy on the heart.
Hi everyone. 1, 2, 3 long live Algeria. God willing Algeria 2- Egypt 1. Oh Lord assist the Algerian team against its enemies.
I like the way in which Hassan El Fad performs in his show.
Salam to all Arabs and Muslims. I hope that you control your nerves because everyone is depressed from the exams, this is true but we should control ourselves and rely on God. This is the environment in which we grew up. There is no power and no will but from God. We hope that we will improve in an attempt to make progress and achieve prosperity. Thank you.
I want "Nass Mlah City". It is the best serial and a serial like "Mawid Maa Al Kadar". Thank you.
Hi and thank you.
Results account 2 bac.
There must be a change in the attitude of authorities and not take poor people to prison. I am sure this law will be implemented only on the poor. Secondly, roads which are in a lamentable state have to be upgraded. The most important thing is to fight corruption. I think that as a result of these tough measures, we will witness a new phenomenon. Running away of drivers as a result of fear and this lead to more accidents.
Is the Highway Code implemented only for the driver but not the public servant?
We don't want just points. As to tonnage, we want it because i twill be implemented only for the citizen not the owner of the truck. Now we have two trucks. They belong to my father. Now the farmer instead of shipping 20 tons at 90 thousand, he will have to divide it in two trucks. Do you understand? This means he will ship 20 tons at 180 thousand. The fee will be doubled for workers. Hahaha! And this is advantageous for us!
Sedition is worse than killing.
If you have no shame of God, do whatever you want!
Wishes of success to all candidates in the Star Academy. Wishes of success to me, as well, because I will take part in the Star Academy show this year.
Thank you my God! God bless you!
Enough, you have gone too far! Enough, enough!
We want our country to remain peaceful.
Hello
Salam. I passed the baccalaureate with a score of 14.45. I am now confused because I haven't applied to any school. Can you suggest me any school where I still can apply? Please reply!
I agree with these statements. I want to add that the merchandises aren't limited to arms; there are also many types of drugs, Cannabis, ecstasy pills and alcohol.
Thank you for this site! What are horizons after the baccalaureate, may God protect you!
Salam alikum. I passed the baccalaureate with a fairly good pass. I really don't know what to do. I studied literature. May God protect you, if you know anything, guide me! I think of studying law. I really hope you will explain to me and guide me if you have experience. Thank you! I will leave my msn, reply may God protect you!
Salam alikum. So you have to go to Agadir and study sociology. The proverb says seek knowledge even if it is in China.
I had a score of 12.60 on the baccalaureate exam. I hate going to university.
This is a shame! On the other hand, we shouldn't be silent about this.
I am married to a Dutch man. We have one daughter. I want to ask whether I can register her in the civil status and get a family booklet.
Salam alikum. I have one problem. I married a young girl about a year ago. I married her under my father's pressure because she is the daughter of his friend. I don't love her. I feel that I can't keep on living with her. I would like to divorce. I can't tell her. What should I do? Thank you! Waiting for your reply! Salam.
Salam Manal. By God, I am very sorry for you. I also have a problem with my husband. We have just married. After only two weeks he wanted to divorce for nothing. All I can tell you is refer him to God. People don't fear God anymore. They commit demonic acts. You have to persevere in prayer and pray at night. God will bring all the good. Be patient, don't accept divorce! It is your right. I think it is your right. Be patient until God makes an outlet.
Salam alikum. I am 25. I have a child, she is two. My husband wants to divorce but I refuse. Can he do that? I don't know the cause as he refuses to talk to me or even talk to my family. Up to now, the court was not yet set the hearing. Please reply!
I am a young man, 21. I have been engaged to a girl for two years. We loved each other. I was observing her living conditions with her parents. Her mother was particularly unkind and ruined these girls. So I thought of marrying her. When I proposed to her, her mother told me we had to stop meeting until we officially marry. We finally married, but she is controlling us although we are officially married. I would like to ask who should keep the marriage deed, is it the man or wife? Please tell me a solution!
Please tell me what do you think about this? I think that rates of divorce have increased highly. There is no more patience and no more loyalty. Radia.
Salam. I would like to know divorce conditions for the community abroad. Thank you!
May God curse this system
Salam alikum. I am a young woman, 25. I am divorced and have one child aged two. The problem is that the family of my ex-husband threatens to take my son from me if I marry. Can they do that? Thank you!
Salam alikum. I would like to know if the approval of the wife is still necessary for a man to remarry another woman. Please reply as soon as possible!
Salam Bassma. I am very sad because you didn't take the title of the star academy . Anyway, you deserve it more than Aziz. This is because he didn't take it thanks to his voice but with the intervention of a Saudi prince. Therefore, he doesn't deserve it. In spite of this you have your dear fans from all parts of the word. You nice girl. You participated in the star academy + Yahya. Ok, take care of yourself darling.
Salam. I am one of fans of the respectable artist Rachid El Ouali. I wish him a successful career, health and wellness. Honestly, I heard that the artist helps young people who have talent in acting given that in Morocco we don't have the appropriate contests. Moreover, studies and specialization in this field aren't possible for everyone. I have talent and love acting. It has been my dream since I was young. I hope some day even a quarter of this dream will be achieved. I ask for help. Thank you!
Tahira, we like you so much, but work hard; you are making us suffer with you. Take care of Mhamad, because you're a good match. Take care of yourself and of Mhamad. I am Hanane from Morocco.
I love Hajar so much.
We love you, Hajar. You have honoured the Maghreb. I'm Sahar from Morocco.
Hajar is the best I love her so much. I want her number, but only to my email address.
I love Hajar so much. I wish I could meet her.
I'm Meryem from Morocco the city of Safi I love you to death Hamid, I love you so much. By God, you're always in the heart, always my love Hamid.
Salam, for me Hajar deserves the star but I don't know why didn't you give her time to make her song.
We ask you to make an interview with Hamid Hadri the third star of the Maghreb Academy. Please, we want his news as soon as possible.
May God rest his soul in peace!
Congratulations to Libyans for the demise of Kadhafi and their liberation!
Bravo!
Moamer is a dog who was humiliated. Humanity was relieved of him. Congratulations to Libya!
I don't know whether I should say it or no. I don't trust this. Anyway, I will let it in the hands of God. I am mechanic. I need a job in a company better than someone who gives me 150 dhs a week. What can I do with this? Live with it or buy a rope to hang myself!
Have some respect for the minds of people, o guys, young people are lost, by God this is unacceptable! When they get hold of a thief, they beat him and then ask him why have you stolen? He hasn't found a job. What can he do? Can anyone accept humiliation for himself? This is unacceptable! Young people in the prime age and university graduates are lost.
Salam. I need a job. But honestly, there are no acceptable jobs in Morocco. They offer low wages and no rights. We hope things will improve.
May God guide the government of Benkirane and consider the situation of people who have no baccalaureate. May God bring someone who understands us with anything.
I am looking for a job.
I am a Moroccan young girl. I live in Morocco. I live in Morocco. I would like to tell you don't deceive the minds of people with the hope of getting a job. Many claim to stretch the hand of help in order to gain fame, this is something common. Don't give false hopes and let young people say we aren't lucky. Don't make us reach the point of believing in unknown things.
I say may God uproot them!
We haven't wished him this kind of death. We wished him a tortured slow death.
I would like to become a famous actress please help me!
Raddad from 10 days he has being replying to the replies. I think that Moroccan to the core has stolen his idea and wanted to become like him. He was one but now they are two sick people who have the same ideas.
Yes, I liked this and wish to see more.
If Khairi leaves the Dar the program should be stopped, because it will no longer have any value. Dounia should leave and Farah- no look and no voice, it's better that they take the initiative and leave the Dar, this is an advice to them.
You will win, God willing! Kisses to you!
Salam alikum. I am from the city of Kénitra, 18. I would like to register in vocational training. However, they didn't want to register me. What is the solution?
I would like to participate.
I am against racism.
This year they were hard with everyone especially literature, it was hard for the people. You must be El Guerrouj in order to pass.
Human rights especially in Western Sahara, this is not how Sharia is implemented. Therefore, we call for manpower and elimination of discrimination.
The baccalaureate is like fried potatoes. We are lazy and we attribute responsibility to others.
When was Moroccan education on the right track? Was Morocco among developed countries in education especially the baccalaureate diploma?
I am a student in the baccalaureate level. I would like to do training but I don't know what are main trainings in Marrakech and what is required in job markets.
I hope from God to help me and help the brothers who are vagabonding in the streets of Tangier.
Honestly, with vocational training you secure your future. Vocational training is better than studies.
From God we are and to God we shall return. My brothers, even if Moamer was a tyrant and Zionist, they shouldn't have killed him in that hideous way. Shame on you! When you captured him alive, you should have let him to be tried and it is the people who should have decided so that his death would heal the wounds of martyrs' mothers. Finally, every soul will die.
I am 20 years old. I dropped out of school in the fifth grade of the secondary. I would like to study vocational training but I don't know which subject to choose.
I see that policy of Arabs have failed.
Morocco forever! Zaki is the veteran of coaches! We want Zaki to return to the Lions. Badou Zaki forever! You should understand yourselves, free Moroccans.
I say we must fight corruption by all means. Thank you.
With Ben Ali, Kadhafi shouldn't have been killed.
Don't rejoice Libyans because Kadhafi although he is dead, you don't know what he has left behind him. The worst thing he could have left is a bomb or something like this. So beware and beware!
Hi! May God rest the soul of Kadhafi! He was a man and will remain a man.
The Moroccan people support Kadhafi. Jews have killed him.
Excellent
I'm Amira and Elham I love Ahmed and Khairi so much
Peace of God be upon you Moroccans. My comment is the following: long life to the king Mohamed VI! I wish his majesty long life. Moroccan people are threatened by unemployment. It has ruined us and the solution is in the hands of the government. Oh Lord assist the Moroccan people, amen!
We don't want to destroy our country. We want our country to be the best country. Our country is full of wealth.
Where are rights of women who are violated by men? Where are laws which punish men who marry them just to defame them, then throw them in the garbage bin? Where is justice? We are enduring men who have no conscience. They exploit Moroccan women for pleasure, then they divorce them without being sanctioned. I am talking about Moroccan women who marry men living abroad. How can she secure her rights after he left her in Morocco? After defaming her, he divorces, then leaves, this poor girl, who is enduring the violence of society, which has no mercy on a divorced woman.
AIT LAHCEN School region of SIDI KACEM needs TISSIR because pupils' families are very poor.
I love FAR to death and like them so much.
I love FAR
I want to study as soon as possible, thank you very much!
Material life!
I die for Bassma. You're a star even if you didn't take the title. You will succeed, God willing. You honoured your country.
I am Inas from Fez. I am crazy for Bassma. The dream of my life is to meet her one day. She is 100% a star. She has lifted the heads of all Moroccans high. I am proud of her, may God protect her for us, oh lord.
I am very happy with the achievements of Hicham. As a runner myself, I want to achieve the success of Hicham.
This is the last thing we can do, singing, and our brothers are dying day after day. Oh may God guide us and bring us back to the right path. Otherwise, in this context, everyone is going to hell.
Hi everyone. I love you Diaa and wish you success.
Hi, I'm Lamia from Morocco I love you Yousra, Farah, Badro and Farid so much, and say all of you Lamiaa and you as well Hamid, good luck
Hi, I love Badro so much, when you left I wet and when you came back I laughed a lot
I love you Diaa so much. May God grant you success. I love you. Fatima from Casa.
I vote for Khairi
Salam. I want to register in this academy. I am in Tiznit. Is it possible for me to register? If yes, I will come these days. Is it possible to know what I need?
I am Asmae, I love you so much Dia and die for Morocco. Work hard and Saad, we love you to death. We love both of you .
Hi star I am Samira from Morocco Sahara you are really talented I mean bravo to all of you.
May God bring all the good!
Go away!
The nicest thing about the Moroccan Caftan is the design, material, Sfifa and final touch. If one thing is missing, the Caftan is not perfect. Even woman who wears Caftan has a high taste.
Great caftans, wow!
I am very happy for the freedom of Libya. But at the same time, I am sad at the death of Moamer Kadhafi. His end was very sad because his people love him. I wished the solution would have been between the people and the president, a solution between the two sides with a useful result. Unfortunately, I hate so much Libya because Moamer Kadhafi did a lot, he gave so much to his country but the result is his death. This is a shame on the Libyan people, shame on them!
I would like to know addresses of design and dress-making schools in Casa.
Salam, I wish all the good to everyone!
Salamu alikum. Dear Sir you people do a lot for mankind to helping single mother. I appreciate that. May God reward you with all good. Please send for me contact e mail of Insaf association. Thanks! Khalid Belgium
Salam. I am a young girl who has problems. I am pregnant in the eighth month. Honestly, I don't know how to act or what to do. I hail from a modest family. My parents don't know that I am pregnant. I can lift my head or venture outside home. If I leave home, I don't know where to go. I hope to find a solution in the coming days may God rest the souls of your parents!
I am a young girl who was victim of violent rape by armed men in May. I was terribly shocked and kept silent because my mother wasn't in Morocco. She went to help my sick sister. In spite of this I kept quiet. After a few months I discovered I was pregnant in my seven month. I was shocked and told my mother when she came. My father doesn't want the child and I don't want to get rid of him. Please help me what to do! I need help to register him in the civil status records. Please give me a phone number or address!
My advice is when there is pregnancy, there is no need to think of putting an end to it. This is shame, shame. I have put an end to a pregnancy without thinking about 10 years ago. But I regret it and I still pay the price for my mistake to this day.
I study in the high school Tichoukt Boulmane in the second year of the baccalaureate. We have teachers who are indecent and unqualified.
Wherever Algerians go, they are honorable. However, it is true they aren't lucky. God is the most powerful! 1, 2, 3 viva Algeria!
Thank you! These are the best comments. However, the king is trying to work hard for Morocco but there are many traitors such as ministers.
I agree with those who fight corruption not terrorism. They are real Moujahids for the cause of God because some think that they are terrorism but this is not true. They are fighting enemies of God and follow the Book of God. They aren't enemies of Islam. In your opinion, are poor people terrorism? This is because you don't take care of them and don't know what they need. This is why you say they are terrorism.
Congratulation Antar Yahia. May God grant you joy, just as you have made us happy! I love you so much! A kiss for you and for Laila!
Is that how you call it - a Ministry of Education? I don't think so. It is the ministry of injustice and marginalisation. Ask yourselves first about your own mistakes.
We want Bado Zaki.
I want 2013, thank you!
Salam. We want Zaki and Zairi. Remove that liar Fakhir, he is not competent. Ifni forever!
Unemployment has killed us and this is a widely spread problem, we study and stay at home. I suffer like all unemployed people. I'm fed up with applying for jobs. I apply to a company and wait endlessly, nothing. If you're not the son of a known family, or if you don't give something, you won't get it. Shame on you Muslims. Sometimes by God I'm depressed from annoyance and staying at home. May God solve this.
salam brothers. A big greeting to all the fans of Cheb Nasro, without forgetting Aicha, Reda and all the dear ones who are present with us. Those who don't know Nasro have lost
Salam alikoum. Cheb Nasro is a very great person. I love him so much, thanks to him, and Hasni because there is still some love in our country. May God rest your soul Cheb Hasni and protect you our dear Nasro.
Nasro and the heart is weakened.
Nasro is the son of my country and very strong, and his voice is very powerful.
There are poor people who haven't yet finished their studies, who are for example still in the secondary education and don't feel like finishing it, but those who have completed their studies will find a job.
The most serious catastrophe is the roads, which are bumpy as the streets of New York! I personally think that this law is useless because those who adopted it are all exempted! How? Because all their cars are state vehicles, which have private drivers, and if the driver commits an offence, he will go to prison and another one will come. So the officials will risk nothing. One spends nothing and imposes sanctions on the poor. I want the strike to last for one month. We want a general strike to protest against the government. May God assist our king!
Maghreb star academy wasn't successful when a conflict rose between you and Hajar.
The borders are closed in order to serve economic terrorism.
I like life without deceit.
Salam to all Arabs. May God protect my people, they're there... inchallah they will get out well and protect all the Algerian nation, oh Lord Amen.
You don't have to study; everyone will fail - ha!
Please be lenient in correction!
Long live the Algerian president Bouteflika and all Algerian generals. Die in your spite Moroccans. Long live Polisario.
Oh Lord pray upon our master Mohamed, his family and companions.
I will take the bac and I will say let's go!
Salam. I am Hassan from Morocco. I am happy with my country Morocco. I wish success to all Moroccans and all Arab Muslims in Libya and all Arab countries.
I am Abdo from Morocco. I want to thank everyone for Star Academy. I'm dying for Hamid.
Israel is behind everything that happens in the Arab World.
Hi Moroccan people, star forever.
Hi. This is Imad from Barcelona, Moroccan. Wow, Star Academy Maghreb, wow it broke the world, by God, bless you. Long live all the Libyans, Tunisians, Algerians and all Moroccans, long life.
A very nice site and very courageous, nice deserves one's contribution.
Very nice Hajar and Abdelhamid.
Salam everyone. I offer my greetings to Nesma channel and hope to be a participant in star 2009. Thank you.
I like this site and thank all the reporters of this channel, thank you.
I love Marwan Chamakh. I ask God to grant him success.
Ghizlane so much, 8 January 1990, Chamakh Marouane 10 January 1984. on which day and city? I love him so much. I ask him for his email or phone number. I want to tell him phone me. See you tomorrow, bye. I love you so much. We have many things in common. I will give him my life if he wants no matter how long it takes, it is I whom he will marry. I want his phone number or email.
Praise be to God, this is a bounty from God.
AFP should stop embarrassing themselves by constantly referring to these "unnamed security sources" who could be anyone on the phone from Gao or someone in Bamako who is himself an actor in this farce. Get a good reporter on the ground or quit reporting - you are being played by the dark forces of the region.
Congratulations ES Setif. Congratulations.
Respect and you will be respected. If this girl has respected herself firstly, then respected her religion, respected her parents, respected the streets, no individual on earth would have touched her. So, may God guide His creatures!
I am a young girl from the city of Meknès. I prefer that the city of Meknès remain the right city to host the international fair every year because it is very nice and is the Islamic capital. It hosts nice historical monuments, with its green landscapes and olive trees. It is the first city chosen to host this fair. It was installed in the best site, near historical sites of the city of Meknès. Thank you. I, in turn, as a citizen, thank and encourage everyone who contributed to this choice.
God willing, we will win and go to the world cup. I wish success and victory to the national team especially against Egypt. I salute Bouguerra, Ziyani, Halich, Matmor, Antar, Belhadj, Mouchia, Ghazal, Saifi, Gaouaoui, Mansour, Morad, Jebbour and Saadane.
So they didn't take us. It's just a bunch of dreams, that's all- let's come back to reality. Are we to the level of international expo 2012, or are we just lying to ourselves? Our brothers are still living in slums.
I am a runner. I would like to participate in athletics. I run the distance of 1500m. I know how to deal with difficulties in a good way.
I am proud of these successes which were achieved by El Guerrouj and all Moroccan runners. Thank you!
This is unacceptable towards the greatest Arab man. He did a lot for his people and liberated then from the coloniser. This is a catastrophe. However, Libyans will soon know the value of this man.
I am an athlete and want someone to help me with a program.
With my total respects to the Moroccan authorities, the rule is unfair. 55 dead people cannot be repaired by 4 years of prison. Thank you.
The ignorant does to himself what the brother can't do to his brother! O ignorant, o Saloua, wake up, study Qur'an and seek the advice of pious people including scholars who are learned in religion. Fear one day when children, fame and money won't be of any use. Islam is a religion of mercy, religion of acquaintance and knowledge. Read Qur'an and you will know that you are inattentive. Woe to the inattentive! You are educated and learned. This is a proof against you in front of God the Almighty. The judgment of educated people like you is greater than that of the ignorant so don't be ignorant o learned woman, may God guide you!
Honestly we have so many hopes on you, by God shame on you.
I congratulate the student Hoda Braro for this success. I wish to myself and to all students success in their studies. Salam.
Not normal!!!!!
Salam alikum. Stirring strife is Haram.
O Lord guide us!
Terrorism in Africa is mad.
Thank you!
Hajar you're wow wow wow, let them die, you're the star and we love you. We're very happy with you. Make God take your right from them. You're a star whether they want or not. They're Maghreb people, what they did is a shame, Hajar if you read this, try to appear in an event so that people get to know the truth. They blame you, or you should protest to uncover them. You're wow wow wow. May God protect you and guard you. I'm Hafida from Casablanca.
I'm Mouloud I miss you, I'm the son of El Hajeb.
This is a shame, Hajar is the daughter of our country even if she did not come to the tour. But the right is the right, and the person who doesn't restore his right has no dignity, but problems. Good luck Hajar, I love a girl named Hajar. A kiss, Khawla from Casa El Maarif, and thank you so much.
I'm from Morocco, I love Hajar so much. Why wasn't she in the tour. I want the phone number please.
I love Hajar.
It's good you didn't go with them Hajar, because they'll just make you miserable.
Salam. May God guide you, be like Egyptians, be proud of your country. Thank you.
Salam alikum. I am the assistant coach of F.C. Ravenna. I would like to lead the national team. However, I don't like the intervention of anyone. I will rely on the national league. I promise you the national team will be very good without payment. Thank you.
Long live us and God willing we will go to the world cup.
Salam. Our king is in good health. He will overcome this crisis because he is a human like all humans who fall sick. This is normal. Morocco is a kingdom which must be preserved with its political regime which is the monarchy. By God he is one of the best kings. He is kind. It is God who grants people subsistence. May God grant recovery to the king of Morocco and assist him against hypocrites. Long live the king, long live the king, long live the king. You must praise God my Moroccan brothers for having the king. You would know his real value if you didn't have him. You always blame the king. You must blame yourselves because you don't want to work for yourselves. It is God who grants subsistence. Protect your king and love him because he loves you. Pray for him and you will see all the problems of Morocco solved and God will assist you. Stay away from traitors who wish you evil.
Everything is possible.
We must stay away from football, you have disgraced us. We have become like monkeys. It is no longer a football, it is no longer a national team, and there is fraud in everything.
Do you love the homeland?
Eh master, congratulations. Well-done and good continuation. Good luck.
I am Bodan, I want to join a team. I am in Mas. I was in Morocco.
Thank you dear Morocco, thank you very much!
May God grant you success!
We elgwabsia love you to death
The topic is very nice, I wish success to everyone, God willing. You should provide more information; good luck.
The topic is very nice. I wish success to everyone.
Designs were very nice, God bless you!
Fnair you're the best, go on like this and raise our heads up, don't mind those who criticize you and go on your career. Don't mind the people like (Zakaria Eddahby from Casa 04 Hay El Falah)
I so much Fnair and I love all their songs so much, I like Achraf so much, he's great, nothing to say about him, I wish you success and a successful career. Long live Fnair!!!!!!!
Greetings of peace. Fnaire is great. Good work.
Hello Fnaire. You are indeed good and entertaining.
The Moroccan dress is really great, enhances the beauty of the Moroccan woman and gives her a distinguished air. With that dress, she can rival the best and most sublime dresses in all parts of the world.
Moroccan dresses are the best dresses in the world. I thank all Moroccan designers. We want to see more.
I wish a good luck to Fnair group, I'm one of the fans of the group.
Salam. I am Saida. I am 18. I like the design of our country. Please, I also want to be with you. I also want to be a dress designer. But I need to study this. I don't know where to go to study and enter this field. Thank you! I need your advice.
Hi! Personally, I haven't seen any Caftan so that I can express my opinion. I am very very sorry!
I would like to learn design via the internet. Thanks to this site!
I am Khawla from Morocco. I have the talent of fashion design both the traditional and modern. I would like to enter this field because I am sure I will succeed in this field. Please tell me if you have some help or information please!
I would like to see some fashion pictures.
I say and stress that the game between Algeria and Morocco will be an example to the Arab nation in everything.
Hi, how are you Farah? I'm from Tangier- my name is Ifdal. Ok, bye.
The situation is getting worse. Foreign forces will intervene and the same situation in Iraq and elsewhere will be repeated. I think the situation in Libya will remain the same.
I want to get acquainted with Migri, is it possible to have his email, I also want to be like him in acting.
Salam to every Libyan! As relatives, we support the Libyan people in their anguish.
I respect your songs because they are romantic and navigating in comfortable airs, wow I have loved them since I was young, I'm a painter, I paint my pictures with them.
You're great Azaz
May God support Muslims everywhere!
Personally you're the best and 'Mgharba Talmout' (Moroccans until death).
Blessed and happy Ramadan. The important is that Big is an artist who emerged in a quick way which made him famous among Moroccans and became loved namely because his songs deal with the social life in Morocco namely the young people. But I have a comment about Big, I hope that he will lessen the use of lowly words as it's very offennsive sometimes namely in some ceremonies where the family is gathered which causes an annoyance to their children. The important is that I wish for Big a successful musical career and more progress as he speaks in our true language which is the Moroccan Darija (dialect) which is on the way of extinction and is marginalized and Moroccans are using another language. It's good to learn other languages, but excluding the original language is a shame on us Moroccan people to marginalize it in this way. This is my comment, I wish a successful continuation for this site as it offers Moroccans an opportunity to express their opinions towards their Moroccan brothers in any field related to the reputation of our country. So pray on the prophet, God's prayer and peace upon him. My greetings to every Moroccan jealous for his country. God grant you success. I dedicate all the songs of Big to my friends : Simo "Laarch", Amjad "Lakraymi", Mayloud "Haj Gladiator", Lyazid "Hda Hlayba", Abdessalam "Chmar". With wishes of succes. Bye.
Salam Bigg, you know, may God make you always the first, you're the Rap but the others Hich Pich of (Fnaire and H-Kayne) we see just their clothes.
Salam alaikoum, I like Bigg but I love so much h-kayne. I hope to find a special introduction about them and about all their new and old songs. Thank you, I hope you will reply very soon.
I am a Tunisian citizen. I like Hannibal channel and its programmes. I have no comment about it.
Hi! We are bigger than their words!
There is no God except Allah, Mohammed is the messenger of God.
I love Bigg so much more than other rappers, a kiss to you Bigg.
I want to learn technology with you.
I love Hajar so much.
I love Hajar, Hamid, Ahmed, Khairi, and Jamal so much. What happened to Hajar is a shame, Hajar deserves the star, long live Hajar.
I thank the sister very much for her article, and I'm sorry about those who talked badly about the rap music, I tell them the issue is greater than you like it or hate it. If you deeply consider the words of rap music, you'll find that it deals with the suffering of young people, tackles your problems and uncovers the faces hidden behind false masks... That's why I address an advice to my brothers to wake up as you're in a deep sleep ... your brother who loves his country to the bone, (Moroccans till death).
ESS power
I am Nadia. I am 17. I love Bassma so much. Nadia from Morocco.
I like Ghani and his songs. I want him to publish his last album.
Nice.
I love you so much Ghani. Ghani from Ouarzazate. I saw you in Comedia 2009 you and Rachid Al Idrissi. A big kiss to you.
I've known Ghani for a long time but he doesn't know me.
How are you? I am Rachid from Tagragra. Ok, are you ok? Is it possible to have the msn? Ok, bye.
Ghani is very ugly and old. He makes himself look handsome. I am just joking. He is handsome. I want to know if Ghani is married.
Sahara belongs to Morocco. We are defending our land and you know this. You will not get a part of the Sahara.
God is sufficient for me and He is the best disposer of affairs. O Lord send them Your wrath!
I ask you my friends to help me. I want to take a loan from Mouqawalati. I have a diploma in dental prosthesis. So how should I do? I am waiting for your reply.
Salam alikum. I ask you for a loan from Moukawalati. I have now a shop for manufacturing shoes but the expenses are high. I need some funding. I want you to help me. I care for a family of 12 members, you know well how much it costs. Sincerely yours.
I am a Moroccan young man. I have a technician diploma in mechanic industry. Now I want to set up my business. Therefore, I want you to help me in setting up the business. May God reward you with good.
We have to show God the Almighty that we are Muslims.
God is sufficient for me and He is the best disposer of affairs! O Lord pour out your wrath upon them at this time and punish them without intercession in their favour!
Street to street??
O Lord, o Lord, what is this vice?! We have to show that we are Muslims. God is sufficient for me and He is the best disposer of affairs!
I love Cheb Mami so much, he's my friend, he's the king of rai, sorry Cheb Khaled, Mami is the the best, he has a great voice, better than you Khaled, I love you but Mami more than you.
God will take revenge! There is no power and no will but from God.
Greetings to all, but mostly to Farah.
May God support the right and assist Mujahids in lifting the flag of the religion. Allah Akbar (God is the greatest), Allah Akbar, Allah Akbar, defeat the infidels, Amen Lord of all creatures.
Morocco is witnessing a crisis of non-proficient teachers in presenting lessons in a positive way. This is a real problem, even though there are hard-working pupils. However, during the period of exams, there is a disturbance by students who rely on themselves and on God first of all, by cheating students. Oh Lord, help us all with the exam! I ask you to pray for us. Zahra. Salam alikum.
"How regretful for the servants!" Where are you Muslims?
God is the greatest, God is the greatest, God is the greatest, God is the greatest, God is the greatest, God is the greatest, God is the greatest, God is the greatest, God is the greatest, God is the greatest, God is the greatest! God's curse on them!
Bin Laden is the man of Islam and those who don't like him aren't Muslims.
Salam alikoum. Muslims will be victorious…God willing…Islam is high. Dakir from Safi.
Life is important for us. God the Almighty offered us life. Therefore, our existence in this life should be in the obedience, worship of God, institute justice and fairness, rule according to the orders of God. Then you will see how important life is.
Osama Bin Laden is the man of the world. Without him, America would have done whatever it wants. Therefore, I love him.
The righteous Salaf is against freedom and against pirate, any girl who wears revealing clothes should be beaten, hijab by force!
I am from Tangier. All responsibility lies with officials for the existence of drugs on Moroccan markets in huge amounts. If they ban them totally, young people will never find them if they look for them. This is the only way which will make them think of stopping drugs. But if they remain in this way, God bless you, drugs are more available than vegetables and food stuff. This is a shame! Don't forget officials that you too have children and there is death in this life!
Drugs are harmful for the human body. One can become addicted. They can prevent the individual from thinking and concentrating. I hope people won't use them.
I fight drugs and those who take them because they are harmful.
My brother smokes and even more, he's not like himself. One week he changed. We were happy. Then we understood nothing. He returned to everything. He even entered a sport centre. But now, if he doesn't take 50 dirhams a day, he isn't happy. He just wants someone to quarrel with. Please, if you have a suggestion, help me.
The problem is with Tunisian politics not Tunisia. There are many Tunisian girls who are veiled, especially because Tunisians know their religion. I see many daughters of ministers who wear the veil. May God guide those who were the cause of banning the veil. I am a Tunisian woman who wears the veil.
There are no replies.
You should respect the orders of God, if you are unaware. He grants you everything you need to live. You fear poverty, but God, who grant us subsistence, grants subsistence to the birds and the fish in the sea. For those who believe that subsistence is granted from power, the bird wouldn't eat anything with the eagle eagle around. Life goes, you don't know when night comes whether you will live until dawn. How many young men after sleeping, awoke in the morning to the unknown, and don't know why? Your brother Anwar from Tiznit.
Salam alikum. I hail from Algeria. Viva the Libyan people!
Ayman al-Zawahiri, you are just a criminal and accuser of apostasy. You are at the service of CIA and Mossad, a cursed terrorist. But why do you kill our brothers in Algeria who are not associated with the government or any side? Moreover, Islam states characteristics which should feature Muslims.
Salam Arab brothers, I wish you success in your duty because it is not an easy one. We are with you, from you and to you. The victory and triumph of God, Amen.
Salam, I thank you so much.
Peace of God be upon you. God has ordered us jihad. So we will lead jihad for the cause of God until the country is cleansed of disbelievers as God says "Think not of those who are killed in the Way of Allah as dead. Nay, they are alive, with their Lord, and they are privileged." There is no reason for fear. God is with us. Peace and blessings of God be upon you.
Where are you, honourable people? If anyone seeks me, he will find me.
I love Nessma channel and wish success to Hajar, Hamid and all candidates, I love you Hajar.
Salam Soraya I love you so so much
Oh God this is my nation, oh Lord!
We ask the Sultan (?) to respect the religion firstly before implementing law because we often respect law and exclude God the Almighty. We hope that the fatwas of our sheikhs and the words of God the Almighty be respected. The law should be ignored because law is valueless in the face of the law of God and for us. We hope that our opinions will be respected. Thank you.
This is a sick and complicated man. A girl aged nine doesn't even know where to sit so what of marriage? This is my number if you have something to say.
Raja forever
A man 37 proposed to me. I am 17. Honestly, I am very stressed. I don't know what to do. I don't want to marry him because he is older than me. I say we may not understand each other. Please I don't know what to do. I want you to help me.
This professor is great. I admire his great personality.
ZAKI
Praise be to God for everything. The exam was easy but the fear surrounding it was great. Regarding the phenomenon of cheating, it still exists. Teachers' concern for their safety makes them ignore it.
As Moroccans, the state whose former king launched the famous expression "the nation is forgiving and merciful", king Mohamed VI should be merciful to his people as they are the cause of stability of the nation. As a Moroccan citizen, I encourage this pardon.
Salam. I am Toufik from Fès. I like so much my country. The coach Bado Zaki has to return to the national team. I don't know what the football federation seeks to achieve with its decisions. I hope they will understand. Enough plundering! We hope to see someone who will understand us. Next game: Morocco 10- Algeria 0) God willing!
The most important thing is the national team.
I recognise al-Qaeda. They are Muslims. They aren't terrorists as they were pictured by America in the era of Bush because Islam threatens the security and stability of America because it is a coloniser of all the world. It is provoking with its words so that Arab governments would fear it. Finally, she deceived them and silenced their parties. So millions of innocent people died. al-Qaeda my brothers is not terrorist. It is Muslim and is fighting all forms of corruption.
I love the music of Cheb Nasro and the best of his songs is 'Bkat Ayne'
I like Fakhir but I want the giant goalie to train Morocco because he was born for Morocco. I love you our league and our king because you are our symbol. God, the nation and the King. Viva the trainers of Morocco! Thank you!
I love you so much Nasro I would like you to be my darling
Salam how are you I love Cheb Nasro so much
Salam alikum. All Moroccans prefer Zaki. When Zaki was with the national team, it was in the best condition. I also ask players to have love for the nation. Viva Morocco!
The national team needs a Moroccan coach who understands players and is concerned about his country.
You're just concerned about money all those who manage the national team! Eh Zaki!
Thank you.
We thank you for your good site!
Salam. I am very scared about the results. Pray with me to pass. I wish success to everyone. The exam was difficult. The teachers were discriminatory and didn't offer equal opportunities. It is clear, all the students have cheated. Only those who didn't leave their tables didn't cheat.
Results of the baccalaureate.
Thank you for everything. May God bring you the best.
May God assist all the Islamic nation and grant success to everyone. I wish success to all Muslims.
We defeated you Egyptians. 1, 2, 3 viva Algeria, yoyoyo.
Please bring us Zaki, you've exhausted us, robbers!
I support founding Islamic banks in Morocco.
I'm looking for a military or administrative service in war.
Hi. How are you fans of the Moroccan team Atletico Tetouan? I wish you success. I wish you success from the bottom of my heart.
I am Soumaya. I am a student in the baccalaureate. I would like to study in a centre. What do you advise me to do?
Salam everyone. I study in the second year of the baccalaureate in physical sciences. I intend to study medicine in future. I don't know which subject to study. Please help me!
I would like to study the subject of Spanish literature. I don't know its advantages and its future prospects. I want a reply please.
I use the words of Nass El Ghiwane in solving my daily problems. Try to use it as well.
What can I do with the level of the baccalaureate?
Apply for an ESTA school for example.
Salam. I am a student in the second year of the baccalaureate. I am undecided between the subject of physical sciences and SVT. Please help me which subject to choose and why! Thank you!
I am a student in the first year of the baccalaureate. I study arts and humanities. I am not skilled in French. What should I do? Please help me!
Salam alikum my brothers. I was married to a man in Belgium and I divorced one month ago. My question is the following: can I marry in Morocco with a divorce from Belgium or do I have to register it in Morocco? In case I have to register it, how long do registration measures last? May God reward you! thank you!
Before this, first of all, I want this minister of the family to be removed from there because she is corrupting Morocco. God says the truth. Peace, mercy and blessings of God be upon you.
Salam alikum. I want you to give me your advice. I married three months ago. My wife is in Europe. I was preparing to celebrate the wedding in the 7th month. However, my wife wants to divorce. I don't know why. I want you to help me in order not to divorce. If I refuse, what will be the ruling in this case? Thank you!
I have been married for 4 months. Now he wants to divorce me. I am not pregnant. I would like to know necessary measures to take in this case. I hope you will help, anyone who can advise me. Thank you very much!
Salam alikum. I divorced seven years ago. I have one daughter. She is 20. I haven't seen my daughter since I divorced and I haven't talked to her to this day. I am suffering terribly and need your help. Thank you!
I married by reading Al Fatiha five years ago. My husband is married and has three daughters. He has a problem with his wife. She can no longer satisfy his rights. Now she has authorised him to marry. However, authorities refuse to authenticate our marriage contract. Now I am lost. Please try to find a solution for me. May God protect you. I am from Oujda.
Rachid I am your fan. I am Amazigh and live in Agadir. Ok, I am mad about your calmness. By God I like the way you speak.
Robbers, robbers and robbers this minister!
Hi. May God assist you and make things easier for you.
Salam alikum brother Rachid. I am Redwane from Sidi Slimane. You know, before I didn't like Moroccan films. It is people who made me love Moroccan films to the point that I now write films. People who direct films have money but don't have ideas. I have films and I have ideas but I don't have money. You know brother Rachid why I love your films? It is because when people see me they tell me are you a relative of Rachid El Ouali? I say he is a relative, my cousin, hahaha. Anyway, I offer you a film I have written. The title of the film is "The orphan". You can begin with it. I am told you have begun directing films. May God assist you. This film tells the story of an orphan and his suffering with his sister and life and he is just 10. I have written this film from my poor ideas/ my greetings Rachid to you and to your family.
Salam. Rachid Elouali is the best actor in Morocco and the World Arab. I think .7394 he can give cinema more and I hope to succeed always for Rachid. May God protect you my brother and your family.
And why is this project not managed by Moroccans themselves?
There is nothing in this. It is forbidden, may God save you. Salam.
I love so much Hajar and Ahmed. May God assist them. Long live Hajora.
Why there is no channel for star academy 24/24 on Nile Sat.
There is no other God but Allah.
Salam alikum Algerians and Egyptians. Don't forget we are Muslims, whatever happens. Shame on us what we are doing. We are making all this fuss for football. This is one of the signs of doomsday. A ball takes our time and Palestinians are dying. You see how the pride of Arabs is!
I am a runner. I was born in 1993 specializing in the distance of 1000m and 1500m. I have a good timing. Therefore, I want to say to Hicham El Guerrouj to visit the city of Eastern Laayoune because he used to train there. Thank you for accepting this request.
Excellent!
I like Hicham El Guerrouj so much.
Ziani is not Messi and Djabour is not Ronaldo.
Salam. I thank all women of Morocco; I wish to see Moroccan Kaftan 2006.
yes the festival of gnawa is great
Thank you, I love Gnawa and Hamid El Asri so much.
I'm from Morocco. Even if he were Jewish, this unacceptable. You should have treated him to a fair trial like Mubarak. Although he used to hate Moroccans, however you should have mercy on the dignity of a person who has become humiliated.
Can you tell me please what symptoms of breast cancer are? Please reply!
I am 18. I have touched my breast by chance and found a small lump. I told my mother about it. I went to my doctor and he told me there is nothing worrying. He reassured me. But now I am worried because I haven't seen another specialist doctor. However, I don't feel any pain. Is this disease not painful? Is there any risk for my life? Thank you!
I am a young man, 29. I have skin cancer. I hope you will help me get a treatment for this disease.
This is a very serious disease. It causes death for some women.
One of my relatives has intestine cancer. But she is poor. I want you to know how to get in touch with an organization which fights this disease. Thank you!
Peace, mercy and blessings of God be upon you. All I can say is that cancer is a malign disease. It gives a strange feeling which is hard to explain. I haven't yet confirmed having the disease, but I can't stop the flow of tears by God. You have to strengthen your fate in God. When death comes, it will come in the way God decides.
Salam alikum. I wish recovery to these patients. Thanks!
Salam alikum. I feel when I am sleeping my back and my side are aching to the point that I can't move. Are these signs of cancer? I can't walk for more than half an hour. I am 36, married and have a little girl who is 2.
Nancy! I love you very much!
I am a high school student in the city of Chichaoua. I am in the second year of the baccalaureate. I would like to know available subjects in vocational training. Thank you!
You're sick, may God guide you.
We thank you for this site. We want to know if there are any open vacancies especially because graduates of a vocational training centres are numerous in different fields.
Can he join them from the elementary education?
Oh things are terrible for me, the date for my final exam of the sixth grade.
Salam. By God I want to understand one thing, how can you be called Salafism, haram.
Please help me. This should be as soon as possible. I need so much a job but outside Morocco in any European country or in the Gulf. I am a restaurant agent. Looking forward to your reply as soon as possible.
I suggest that the mentality of the people should change! change all the government! Are you mad? May God grant success to the king. Long live King Mohamed VI.
I am a young girl. I would like to work in any respectable field. I haven't studied up to a high educational level. I would like to provide for my young daughter. May God reward you with all the good!
Salam. I hope you will save me from unemployment. I am looking for a job of any kind. Please help me, may God reward you with all the good!
I thank you for the channel I want you to add to the site registrations of the Koran reciters in Morocco like the one who has been reciting on the first channel for three years.
May God reward you for this channel, and thanks to God, now we have a channel dealing mainly with religious issues. The channel is taking its place among other satellite channels. May God reward you and assist you. Salam alaikoum.
The people of Morocco support the people of Libya.
I wish stability for this country. This is the most important thing.
Long live Algeria against the well of Egyptians filthy dogs. We must humiliate and debase them 6-0 hhhhhh.
This is a big problem widely spread in Morocco.
I hate you Badr! I am Oumaima from the city of Salé. I say you have no feelings. Finally, I say you should retire from acting. Bye! I hate you, I hate you!
You will keep on teasing Moroccans until you make them mad or call them disbelievers in God.
Salam alikum my brothers. Annas channel is a channel of right but most people don't want the right.
Hi and welcome, I thank this programme.
I assure you these people who consider themselves today to be ministers, parliamentarians, presidents of the commune of Anfa have all manipulated residents of shanty towns. They have promised them many things which are their right. They divided them between the pigeon and balance parties just to vote for them. But ultimately, they left them there so that they would vote for them in the upcoming elections. They will remain in this situation every year at the period of elections. One parliamentarian comes to dance for them a little. But when she goes to parliament, she forgets about them.
Long live Mouloudia of Algiers. They win both in football and handball. If you have something to say, let's meet in Bab El Oued. Long live Walid. We won't let down MCS.
Salam Hajar I love you so much
Remili Hamzaa, God willing, the supercup of Africa.
You have built a nice youth center.

To hell with America!
By God I love you with all my heart, especially Nadir, may God grant you success and progress.
I am Zineb from Morocco I love the programme so much! It shook the Arab Maghreb. I thank Rooula Saad. Thank you.
Star academy will be unsuccessful I see that only the stupid enter it…I hope that it will change a little.
This is very nice.
Look at those who work at 50 dirhams per day.
ok
Many congratulations to all Algerians for the glorious Independence Day, 1, 2, 3, viva Algeria!
Hi Rachid. I want to tell you that you are the best actor in the Arab World. But your problem is that sometimes you behave as if you are in Europe because you have begun acting some sexy roles.
I want to find a job.
I don't know.
Nice but it is not complete. There is still something missing. Thank you very much for the job!
May God grant them happiness but Antar is younger than her!
Hi. This is the first time I visit this site. Therefore, I cannot say anything until I read it. Thank you.
I want Youssef Mokhtari.
Nasro I love you so much.
The Sahara is Moroccan despite any obstinacy, Assakir Algerian.
Salam alikum. I really love Nasro and the song "ya mar et khalkak rabi lia spisial" (Eh woman, God created you special for me), God willing, good work. Long live Nasro and the late Hasni.
Welcome to all the fans of Nasro in Casa. God willing 15 August 2008. Thank you everyone.
I love you Nasro. My brother you are the best of the best. May God grant you long life.
I like Rabie El Kati so much. I hope he will bring us something new. His movies are nice, like he is. I wish him good luck. May God make you happy!
Salam. I like all forms of dancing including hip-hop, Indian and rap. I am skilled in dancing. Please help me, I am waiting! Thank you!
It is really an extraordinary description! I like the south of Tunisia.
We want Zaki or Roger Lemerre for the national squad. Anyway, the world cup is lost by those who have no pride, sons of the nursing bottle. This is true. If you have anything to add, welcome.
Salam. I am the son of Khouribga. I want to mention that the sons of the city are lost in unemployment. They don't benefit anything from phosphate. The sons of other regions work in our city while priority should be given to the sons of the city. As a result of this discrimination, young people are moving to the abyss, drugs, vagabondage, poverty…We ask for our rights we the sons of labourers. Thank you.
I love you so much Nessma. When will you launch the starac?
Salam everyone
I hope the exam will be reasonable!
May God grant success to everyone and us, God willing!
Why bark like dogs? The Sahara is Moroccan and it will remain Moroccan.
Thank you for the exams! They were great!
I want Baddou Zaki to return because all Moroccans love him. I also hope that new coaches call the Moroccan player Zairi because I consider him one of the best Moroccan players.
The federation must give an opportunity to Moroccan coaches especially Badou Zaki and allow Zairi to join the national team. Thank you. Good luck and success to Lions of the Atlas.
I am a fan of Badou Zaki, Soufiane Aloud, Hajji and Zairi. I wish them good luck. Long live Morocco.
I tell you Fakhir forever because he offers an opportunity to local players unlike Roger Lemerre who brought some samples even if we have better than them in the league 0672. Wydad forever. Thank you.
I love Zaki, Roger Lemerre, Youssef Hajji, Alkhanasa, Taarabte, lions of the Atlas.
Honestly, Morocco did no good in football, it must see whether it can do something in running.
Zaki, Zaki, ho ho, Zaki, we want the son of the country, long live Zaki, long live Zaki.
Salam sister Hanan. How are you? I respect your opinions regardless of its content. Opinions differ, racism exist wherever you go. If you are an educated and intellectual girl you won't allow yourself to say this. But I can't tell you anything. Everyone expresses his intellectual level. Beauty is present everywhere and ugliness is also present. If you look for something, you will find it. Thank you sister.
Hahaha. What is wrong with you darling Loubna? Don't you trust that Rabie and I love each other? I replied for Rabie because my lover doesn't have time for your childish acts. Tell me first, do you know Rabie, have you met him? This is a shame. Have some respect for yourself Loubna. Bye. I love you darling Rabie, a kiss. I will wait for you beauty. Phone me. I have a surprise for you. I came to Morocco today and want to have dinner in a restaurant, just you and I my life, sweetheart. I died for you, hahahahahahahahaha. Ok Loubna, you have no place between us.
Hi. I hope you are well, my sweet Rabie El Kati. I wish you more success at the world level. "Trailer Smile". I watched the movie, it is nice, but I have one reservation. Evil roles don't suit you. You are better in romantic and kind roles. But despite this, beauty, you were fascinating. I have nothing to say. You're the handsome man from Taza, hhhh. I am always around Taza people. This is not a compliment. I like it because Rabie El Kati lives there, he was born and grew up there. Taza pride! A kiss to Rabie, Hanan.
Hi darling Loubna. It seems you love Rabie. Are you beautiful at least? I am Hanan hhhh. In Marrakech, you're all ugly. You have no beauty and are racists. Bye. Reply, I am waiting for you. Ok, bye. A kiss to you, my darling Rabie.
Salam. Are the statements of Ranya true, Rabie, or are they just lies? Please reply. We want to know.
Salam alikum. I am Mohamed from Berkane. My mother has cancer. When we went to get a treatment, we didn't even get the simplest care nor any moral support. What we see in the media is different from the reality.
hahaha, this a serial of the Stone Age. What is this rubbish? hahaha.
Egyptian serials, Moroccan films and holy Qur'an. Blessed Ramadan. May God grant you in it health and wellness. Thank you very much for the programmes.
It's a very good site
I love Moroccan films so much. I hope to be an actor like Sanna Aakroud.
Salam I would like to watch the Moroccan serial "Rammana wa Bartal" on the net.
This is a good site on the contrary that's why it should be used in a good way we ask God to help all the victims of this natural catastrophe
everyone inquiring about this site should know its importance, we ask God to help everyone who lost his father in the earthquake of Al Hoceima or lost his mother and many thanks to the king
May God grant you happiness and blessing.
Fakhir
God knows better! I don't trust the press and don't trust salafists.
I'm Naima from Morocco, I hope that Tangier will host it because if Tangiers hosts it many things will be achieved, and many young people will find jobs in order to show their skills, I hope that it will take it, I pray with my heart, my mind and all my soul for Tangier 2012
Inchallah it's Tangier that will take it because it's the bride of the north, nice and deserves to take it
You're right, Ouarzazate is fascinating. I visited this year. It is beautiful.
Fear your Lord in what you praise! Are Nas Al Ghiwane our Prophets companions to be taken as role models? Are we a nation of singing? Fear your Lord, fear your Lord!
Salam alikum. Our country is nice and great. I hope it will host 10.000 tourists. There some nice regions in Morocco but researches have not discovered it. I state for example the cave of Idawzdot in the commune of Nihat, district of Ighram, Caidat of Atar Nwaman, province of Taroudant. I hope it will be taken care of and receive many visitors. By the way I am from the region and I liked it so much. Thank you.
This site was of great help to me in my research.
This is nice but the topic isn't complete. You missed many information Sara, but not bad.
Good luck Atlas Lions namely Alloudi. May God make him recover. I love you so much Alloudi. Long live Morocco, Casa and Raja.
Long live Chamakh. Long live Morocco. Long live Mohamed 6. Long live Morocco, Morocco.
I want Morocco.
There's just a show
I thank the Moroccan national team so much. I'm Ghizlan from Khouribga.
I love Nass El Ghiwane to death because they sing about something which exists and experience especially Larbi Batma. I like him so much. May God rest his soul. I like the name Batma so much. I suffered so much for this name. I die for it. I wished my sons to have this name but unfortunately we weren't destined for each other. I am Siham. I still love Yassin Batma because I die for him. May God help him and assist him with a good girl, oh Lord.
Cavalliiii?
Salam alikum. I would like to know why they have made the standardized exam difficult. Why? Why? I wish success to everyone.
Salam alikum. I wish you success in your life similar to your success in your studies.
As a student, I say that she worked hard and dedicates a lot of time to her studies. Every person can achieve this result, but only with perseverance and good manners; this is the basis of success. We hope to achieve this result, God willing.
We hope from God all to pass. I know that all candidates are scared even if the exam this year was easy. However, the inspection was bad. I hope we will all pass. I hope we will all be happy.
Congratulations, sister Sara. I think you deserve these points for your hard work. I want to tell you that people like you are very rare in Morocco.
You are a hard-working student. But what do you think about students who cheat?
Long live Algeria. God willing we will defeat Egypt.
This film is a catastrophe. We should watch out for America. This is a trap for occupation.
My husband and I want to buy a taxi. Can small loans institutions lend us this sum to begin our life? Thank you!
I wish success in your life and success forever.
Honestly, I work as a security guard. It is full of hardships brothers. I work 12 hours standing on foot under the sun near the sea in a hotel in Agadir. But the wage is miserable. There should be a solution to security guards.
Salam. I am Bouchra. First thing I offer my sincere thanks to this site which allows all students to express their opinions. Honestly, I am very happy for Sara Touahri for her success especially the good grade. Moreover, the sons of the Moroccan people are happy for you because you have honoured our country. We wish you success in your educational and personal life.
I really admire your opinion!
I am looking for a job.
This year exams were easy. However, I think that supervisors are lenient with students because sometimes they detect them cheating but they don't implement law.
I am one of your fans and I follow all your works. Honestly, God bless you! Go ahead! You're a great young man! Take care! I am waiting for you in the city of Meknès. I hope you will come to visit it.
May God protect you Mohamed VI, our king!
This is good!
Go ahead, go ahead greens. 1, 2, 3 long live Algeria.
I personally was affected by the demise of Kadhafi. This is not the way he should be killed. Would you accept this for your father? In spite of this, he is Muslim and Arab.
O servants of God! In Morocco the sons of the rich presently get scholarships while we sons of farmers and the poor get nothing. This is unfair o servants of God! What happened to justice? Find some solution! Morocco ranks at the bottom in terms of education worldwide because these matters drive students to drop out of school.
Congratulations for your victory! God willing a new Libya!
I didn't like this topic.
Salam, I want to enter hotmail in the electronic mail, I love Rachid Alwali, and he has nice films. I wish him success but I love nice films.
Please tell me what do these associations require if you want to work with them? Do they require a university degree? Please reply!
I'm Ghizlane from Morocco, I encourage all the students and I encourage Hajar, Abdelhamid, Kawtar and Farah
I love the Moroccan Caftan so much.
God bless you!
I would like to see new designs.
Thank you very much for this presentation!
Thanks to Moroccan designers. I like this show to make the Moroccan traditional dresses more famous.
My name is Houda from the city of Rabat. I am a fashion designer. I am proud of this job.
You have exaggerated, shame on you, it is all talk and no action!
The best traditional dress in the world is our Moroccan dress. It is sublime and nice.
I have a diploma in word processing. I am married and I have a son. I have to provide for him. He needs me so much. Now I am looking for a job. Please rescue me from this catastrophe of my life. I am suffering. I am 23.
I am a university graduate young girl in the subject of geography. I am looking for a job. Stop the lies you are saying! There are no job opportunities. Those who have jobs are the only ones who work. If there are any entry exams for a job opening, they are for the ones who work again.
This is incredible what you did, o disbelievers!
"Indeed, Allah confers blessing upon the Prophet, and His angels [ask Him to do so]," while others denigrate him! This is unacceptable, unacceptable! O Lord, You Who know, take revenge!
This is unacceptable. All Muslims must stand up in one hand for the religion which is Islam not through violence but in a peaceful way. Thank you!
I seek refuge with God from the anger of God.
Come to us we miss you.
Bigg is really great
I want to get a job.
(already in English)
Can I participate with you in the festival?
Most of these comments are backward.
By God, this is the era of vice! The criminal immoral people who don't observe fasting in Ramadan are now defending their rights! Violating the sanctity of God has become a right! By God, this is the era of strangeness where the liar is believed and the dishonest is trusted. "And those who have wronged are going to know to what [kind of] return they will be returned."
It is the duty of every Muslim to fast in Ramadan. Anyone who doesn't fast is infidel.
God is the greatest and he is above every tyrant!
Hi I'm Sanaa from Morocco I liked so much the idea and wish we'll have a united Maghreb and wish success to Abdelhamid, Hajar, Farah and Kawtar
I love Cheb Mami to death. May God grant him long life and long live Algeria. Long live the Algerians.
Thank you Cheb Mami I love you from the bottom of my heart.
Viva Libya, Libya, Libya! From Algeria.
Salam, I'm Nadia from Morocco, I encourage Hajar the way she talks is too humble, I say to Farah that she's amazing and to Abdelhamid the handsome you're great and also Kawtar they're all great except Soraya and Firas I don't like them and even Nabila Nessma should reconsider her
They should have let them, God the Almighty will avenge them.
For me Farah, Hajar, Yosra, Farid, Ahmed, Abdlhamid, Badro, Jamal and Kawtar are the best
Salam alikum. I am a teacher. I really want to buy a car. However I want it without bank interests. I don't know how to get it. Don't forget my brothers that God the Almighty said about those who deal in usury "Take notice of war from Allah and His Messenger". So how can we fight our Creator? I hope there would be Islamic banks like such projects!
What are the conditions of Renault Morocco to sell sale by installments? I would like to buy a Kangoo car.
May God guide all the Umma of Mohamed, peace and blessings of God be upon him.
May God guide every believing soul!
I will sacrifice my soul for you beloved messenger of God.
There is no other God but Allah, Mohamed is the messenger of God whether you like it or not.
Salam alikum or Shalom Arab Jews. The Algerian history has an ancient history unlike the kingdom of Morocco or Libya which collaborate with Jews. You rats of Libya will regret having believed the allegations of the Moroccan intelligence. History will show that Algeria has nothing to do with this. If Algeria doesn't intervene for a peaceful solution, you will see hell. The solution for Libya is in Algeria. I say to Moroccans who interfered, go and kiss the hand of your lady Mariem then talk about Algeria you cheap.
Why wasn't there in the national team an Arab coach like (Hassan Harmatalah or Mustafa Madeh)...?
I am a young Moroccan girl. I want to marry an Iraqi according to the orders of God and tradition of His Messenger. He is Muslim, and religious. I have all the necessary papers. We have obtained a certificate of capacity to wed, which is hard to get. But I've found a more difficult problem, the visa. He applied for a visa two years ago and didn't get it from the Moroccan embassy. Please help me, especially anyone who has experience or if you're a girl married to an Iraqi. Have mercy on those on Earth and God will have mercy on you.
salam alaikoum
Salam alikum. I want to know the number of days, thank you!
Is there a way to know the number of my points at the social security fund? Thank you!
it was very nice to hear to those interesting statments...............
I think the country will never move forward with this because I live in a popular neighbourhood and see what happens for young boys who aren't even 15. They are addicted to drugs. I am very scared because every day there are quarrels and I blame the state which doesn't take care of this phenomenon.
The scourge of drugs has spread. They found no one to hold them accountable and thus it has spread even more in the Arab and Islamic world.
I want to find the number of the CNSS centres.
I have married someone in France. I have a diploma as secretary. I would like to complete my studies in France. However, I don't know what to do. Moreover, I graduated from vocational training, ISTA in Tiznit.
What is this? I say just one thing. Libyans know each other and know Kadhafi. What has the Arab League done for us? There is no solution except the air embargo because if they don't implement it, Kadhafi will destroy all Libya and there is nothing to stop him. God is with us, God willing things will be good! Salam.
God willing Osama and get rid of Kardafi very soon! Thanks!
Oh Lord grant victory to Islam and Muslims in all parts of the world, Amen Oh Lord of humanity.
Oumeyma from Tunisia. I don't like your way of killing. Are you blowing up cars and killing innocent children and innocent people. By God this is unacceptable. Is there no better way? Thank you.
I'm Oumeyma from Tunisia, I like this site. May God assist you. I encourage all the colleagues to visit it and inchallah
In the name of God, peace and prayer on the last of prophets I'm asking myself and ask you as well why does terrorism target only Arab countries. Why doesn't it target western States , everyone is wondering and they don't know the reasons. The causes Muslims are leaving the faithfulness to God and the tradition of His prophet, so God filled their hearts with terror. Thank you.
With God's support He will assist you, I wish you success.
Happy new year Amazigh people, pride to Berbers, Berber forever 100%.
I'm Yassine, they call me king of attractivity. My personal opinion is that when I talk about a type of music called hip hop I say we're like the words we speak. We're young people, which is the dialect, among these words there are broken words and Arabic, words broken. In hip hop all the words which are spoken in their music are the words of the street and I like this type of music which is hip hop, life without hip hop isn't a life.
Hi, you are very beautiful and sensitive, sweetie I die for you.
Many congratulations to the Libyan people, many congratulations to Arabs for this great victory! Hasan from the Great Arab Maghreb.
May God protect you my country.
Moroccans emigrate from their county because Moroccans don't have job opportunities. This is why they emigrate.
Greetings. I'm Amazigh, my parents are Amazigh. Therefore, the world should know that the Arab Maghreb is Amzigh. Saying that Moroccans are Arabs are just words by Arabs in Morocco who are of Yemeni origin. Therefore, they say that they brought Islam to Morocco but this isn't Islam, this is colonisation. But we Amazigh people hold on to Islam more than Arabs, there's much to say about Amazigh people.
Why don't you broadcast the Arab Cup, thank you.
I am Bm. I love rap music especially songs of Bigg. They are great. Thank you Bigg.
I love Fnaire to death. I hope to be with them in the band and sing with them though I am aware this is just a dream which won't be realized. Anyway, I also like Bigg. I tell them well-done, well-done, I love you.
Eh guys do you remember the day on which the plan was uncovered and the artist emerged in Derb Soultane and (unclear) spoke.
Long live Algeria.
The national team has humiliated us! Thank you!
This is good!
As Moroccans living in Italy, we call for the appointment of Zaki as coach of the national team.
We want Badou Zaki to train the Moroccan national team.
By God, this is a shame! Aren't these officials ashamed of themselves? As if they are proposing to a married woman! The team is on one side and the coach is on the other! This is a shame! No matter what they will do, in the end they will bring Badou Zaki. I love you Badou Zaki the great! I hope they will call Skoma and Omar Najdi to play in the national team.
God bless all Moroccans!
We want Zaki. He is everything. We want Zaki son of our country.
I hope from my heart the national coach, Bado Zaki, will return. With him, it was all glory, with my respects to Mr Fakhir!
I want Bado Zaki, because he holds the secret for the national team.
We want Bado Zaki to train players.
This project is ambitious and successful 100%.
Salam. How are you? I would like to know all news about football via msn.
We support Islam.
To say the truth, they did well to her. As for the girls who say where is the police, where, where… go to wear your clothes and have some shame!
Thank you.
Why haven't you published my comment? Is this democracy?
Thank you sister Nasima. I am from Morocco. You said that Moroccan films are better than Algerian ones. But you also have good films like "Taksi, Lmakhfi" and old films such as "Lmoukaouama". Write Jihad Oujda.
Salam alikum. Honestly, the national team has just found now a real coach. I wish all Moroccans success.
Thank you for your efforts! Let Zaki do his job, may God rest your souls in peace!
Badoo Zaki is a great coach. He is the coach who has brought pride to us and to the Moroccan people. I hope from the depths of my heart that the performance of our national team will improve and that they will restore to us confidence in them. O Lord, amen! Good luck!
Pray with me to pass! This baccalaureate is driving me crazy!
Ok guys, congratulations we hope there will be no fraud as we don't need any problems. Politics is not all the same.
I love so much Azahi.
Nass El Ghiwane are the best Moroccan group, Assiham should be taken care of.
May God assist you and grant you success to serve benefitters.
Salam alaik cheikhna, wish you long life, may God protect you.
I'm a fan of Nass El Ghiwane and I tell them may God grant you success, salam alaikoum
Congratulations for your revolution!
I am divorced and have one daughter. I would like to marry in a country other than Morocco. I want my daughter to be with me. By the way, I am her custodian. What can I do?
Hi! I would like to ask about the new law which grants allowances to divorced women. When will it enter into force and what are necessary measures? What are the necessary papers I have to prepare? By the way, I have two daughters, 5 and 3. I don't have any personal income and my family is poor.
Salam alikum. I have been married for eight years. I have two children 7 and 3. My husband lives in America. He comes every eight or nine months. We live with his parents. The house belongs to my husband and they live with us. However, I don't have freedom. They consider me like a maid not a married woman. I don't have any freedom at all. Now I don't want to live any longer with his parents and they don't want him to take me there or live alone in my own house. My children have the American citizenship. I am concerned if I divorce that I don't have custody because they are American. Please help me! I am tired of this life of humiliation. Thank you! Please reply!
My name is Wafaa. I am 26. I have two children. Their father maltreats me. I told him that I want to live on my own but he refused. He left me alone with the kids. Tell me a solution!
My name is Aya. I have been married for two years and I have two kids. I am not happy in my marriage. I am victim of a lot of jealousy from my husband in addition to insults and even beating. Honestly, I can no longer bear this style of life. When I asked for divorce, he accepted on the condition that I renounce all of my rights. So I accepted. Please, I would like to know what I should do in order to start the divorce procedure. Thank you!
I have been married to my husband for 10 years. We have children. Recently it appeared that he has an illegitimate child who is 18. What is the legal way to recognize him? Please reply as soon as possible!
May God reward you with good for this site through which we read all topics! Thank you!
Salam alikum. My problem is with my father who has been married to my mother for over 30 years. He has always been beating her and is violent with her. Now we have left home. He took our items and says he would pay money so that we wouldn't take anything from him. Now he is selling the house. Please advise me what is our legal position? By the way, we are all adults (I am married and live in the Netherlands). Will my mother after all these years go to the streets with my brothers? Please help us!
I love Hajar so much, but has another one begun?
Salam alikum wild people, this is the scourge of peace.
Hi everyone. I love Star Academy. I love Yousra so much. I love her to death. Ok, bye. A kiss.
Salam alikum. I am a student. I study in the first year of the secondary, sciences. I want to study electric engineering. Can I study it with this branch? If the answer is no, please guide me how I can achieve my goal without losing one year of studies. By the way, I am excellent in scientific branches. Thank you. I wish this site to be a cause for success for all visitors. Bye.
Star Academy is a successful programme but not accepted religiously as there are there sights which don't respect our honourable religion.
I hope to be like Hicham El Guerrouj. I hope that someone provides me with trainings of El Guerrouj. I am proud of him because he belongs to my country.
Hicham is the best runner. He honoured Morocco, Arab and Muslim countries. We hope from God that other champions will come after Hicham in the same level and lift the flag of Morocco high.
I am an athlete in the royal army. I ask God to become like this champion. I have always dreamt to reach his level, Hicham El Guerrouj. Peace of God be upon you.
I will become a big runner in 2010. I will break the world record in honour of Hicham El Guerrouj and in honour of the people of Twaza from their youngest to the oldest.
May God protect you Hicham. You have never disappointed Morocco. May God give you a bag of money. I say Amen, Amine from Fes.
Each of you is a shepherd, and every shepherd is responsible for his herd.
Raja de Casablanca team is always great. We will defeat Sétif of Algeria, God willing, as long as Alloudi will play. I have an opinion about Raja players. You have a "hindering" style of football that we advise for construction work, not in playing football with a great team like Raja. There is the example of Mitouali, who has gained to much weight. This the result of going out with girls and not sticking to training. Thank you.
Wish you success and progress!
I wish recovery to all patients. May God help everyone! Don't forget it!
We really need awareness-raising about this disease. My mother is 50 and they've discovered final-stage uterine cancer. Unfortunately, it's spread to other parts of her body. Does she have any hope now to recover, even a small chance?
We got rid of them people.
Nancy, you are beautiful. Stay that way. I love you very much.
Salam alikum. I would like to address my thanks to his majesty the king and to Lala Salma. I want to inform him about what happens in Ibn Rochd Hospital in 40, the place where cancer is treated. Patients are violently addressed even if they need respectful care. Thank you!
I would like to know information about cancer. I think that I have this disease.
More beautiful than roses. I love you Nancy. Najat.
Salam alikum. I am a Moroccan and I encourage this initiative. I hope it will be serious and with a long-term vision, because it will boost our overall security.
My name is Ghizlane. I am looking for a job in Spain.
Salam. I am Bouchra from Tan Tan. Now I passed to the bac year. Honestly, I worked hard in the regional exam but I was shocked. I had 5. I want to know the necessary score in the national exam in order to pass. Thank you.
Salam. I am Mhamed from Salé. I want a job as driver. I have a driving license category (b) and (c). Thank you! **Phone number deleted by editor**
Salam, how are you? Is it possible to know where are results announced?
I want to know one thing. I am entitled to sit for the second round and I am concerned. I don't know if it is similar to the first session or more difficult. Ok, please if anyone has gone through this experience, reply to me please.
I am looking for a job outside Morocco.
Salam alikum. I want to ask about the passing rate in Morocco this year.
Salam everyone. I admire you Rachid El Ouali as a great actor in Morocco. My wishes to you of happiness and long life and to your family. I hope that you write us. You are very dear to us. Kelaa Seraghna.
God is the greatest, o hypocrites! Who kills old men, women and children? Is it Israel and America or Al Qaeda? God willing, victory will be for Islam and pride will be to Islam against the will of infidels and hypocrites. God is the greatest! There is no other God but Allah.
Hi. I am a Moroccan girl and I am proud of it. I liked so much this article.
They will not add them even after 1000000000000000000000 years and even then it isn't sure whether they will add them or not
A constructive and courageous article! Thanks to the author and to Magharebia!
Still standing…
In the name of God the most gracious the most merciful, I hope everything is fine.
Islam is the key of humans.
Islam calls for peace and not for destruction. Anything that causes destruction has no right in Islam. This is my own decision. As for those who kill their Muslim brothers and others in the name of Islam, they aren't Muslim because they are taking Islam as cover in order to achieve a hideous and destructive goal, for their personal interest and to disfigure their country today. As for Islam, it is the religion of right and peace. If the prophet of God, peace and blessings of God be upon him, had never killed under the flag of God wrongly, how can they kill innocents under the flag of al-Qaeda? This is injustice and hatred because our country is beautiful without them and our king is the best king because he speaks the truth under the oath of Islam. Thank you!
Welcome, how are you my brothers, is everything ok? My name is Mohamed from Morocco. I wish to participate in Star Academy. I sing western songs nicely. I am very happy.
I am Aabir. I would like to participate in the programme of star academy, please. I die for it not for anything just because I want to sing and show all my talents.
I like star academy.
Hello. I am Sanae from Morocco. I love songs. My hobby is art. I want to be a student in the Maghreb star academy. Thank you.
Badrou I really wept a lot but it's destiny, you're the handsome, you're the academy and my soul, I've been weeping for days for you, if only you knew how much you're dear to my heart, Laila.
I wish a good luck to all participants but I like Yousra and Hajar
These are not men.
I liked this school because it has all the qualifications which grant kids an opportunity to show their skills. This is shown by the fact that we have to build a good national team in the future. I personally want to enter this school but don't know whether they still take students. Good luck! Long live the king!
Define what Malouf is.
I love Saida Fikri so much, especially her songs.
Why is there a crisis of golies? The best goalie in the Moroccan championship is Fouhami.
Hi! I am 20. I hope to learn football.
The west is seeking its interests and winning card. The winning team will be their friend because in this place there is oil. They should take it as they have taken the gold of Iraq, Kuwait, Bahrain and the whole Gulf.
Hi, I like Hajar and Hamido and hope that they'll both win.
The prophet of God, peace and blessings of God be upon him, said "kill those who have no jealousy". God and His prophet speak the truth. May God not kill our jealousy!
Honestly, when I read the level of this student, I wept from joy! God bless you! May God protect you for your parents and all Morocco! We all Moroccans are proud of you. May God grant you success in your life in general, Houda Abrar. Good luck!
Al Fatah forever! NO DEMOCRACY WITHOUT POPULAR CONGRESS! AL FATAH IS AN ISLAMIC REVOLUTION!
This exam of the baccalaureate is all fraud and associates favouritism. Some never studied and passed. They don't distinguish "Alef" from a stick and passed just because their fathers are influential, someone recommended him or his mother is the friend of the principal.
I really love Bassma. But there is just one think I don't like in her. She doesn't talk in Moroccan dialect. I want her to speak it to make it known and it will become known for them. Thank you.
I love so much. Your voice drives me crazy. You deserve to be the star of the academy 6. You have honoured Morocco. It is all with you. I love you. Soukaina from Morocco.
Thank you, but I want the life of the artist Belkahia. Thank you!
Hi. I love you so much Bassma. I want to see you, have your phone number or msn. We love you to death here in Agadir. I hope you will take the star title. You have honoured our country and your family. Bye.
It is a good book which I liked.
Well one! God bless you my sister! May God protect you! Thank you very much for the advice.
I am Hanan from Tafraout. The exam was difficult especially maths. Supervision was very stiff.

May God curse those who put the exam.

The national team doesn't have players to compete for any title.
Hi! I am Ilham from Souk Sebt. I want to say I have previously gone to Ouarzazate. I am crazy for the city. It is very nice like a heaven. The air is pure and it is very relaxing!
I'm from the city of Ouarzazate, the capital of the south. It has nice and attractive sights. It hosts the biggest studio in Africa. It also has a nice landscape, especially in Imrgran.
Salam. How are you? I'm looking for the regions of Zagoura and Ouarzazate.
Salam. Praise be to God for our country!
Salam alikum. I hail from Ouarzazate. You're welcome there. I wish it prosperity and progress. I greet people of Imghran Oinkal.
The city of Ouarzazate is a very nice city with its nice landscape. I hope you will visit it at any time.
Hello, I'm Ahlem, you cannot imagine how much my son Omar loves you, and with the help of God you'll be more successful and famous. They want to know whether the boy and girl with whom you made the clip are your children or no. We love you so much, thank you. I'm Ahlem thanks.
Greetings, my Amazigh brothers and sisters! Welcome in this site! Bye!
Thank you very much!
Hi everyone! I would like to say to Sara your topic is very nice although you forgot many things. Anyway, wish you will add other things in future, God willing. Ok, bye and good work!
I used to hear that Marrakesh was nice. This was confirmed when I visited it especially Jamaa El Fna. 8602
Salam alikum. This is Mohamed from Morocco of Amazigh. I thank you for this topic, which tackles Tifinagh script. Now I study it.
In my heart and pride there's always Raja, the club of Raja.
I would like to thank their master for his loyalty. Long live the profitable Morocco. The sons of the people throw themselves in the sea!!!
Greetings to you my brothers and sisters. Salam alikum. The problem present in football is the same as in all fields. Officials are never interested about results. This is reflected by the fact that the wage of Zaki, may God protect him, is known. He had no bonuses and nothing. He is limited to Casa. As to foreigners, they agree with them on a price and the rest you know in the pocket. One more thing, one is specialized in agriculture and manages sport. A big contradiction. I think officials are aware of this but as we have said, they don't care about results. They are only interested in bucks, money my cousin. Why have we sacked Zaki? This is because his wage was barely enough for him in addition to the rest which remains for them. As someone said, as long as you are in Morocco, don't be surprised.
It wasn't her who had the highest score. You just have to check your references. I have achieved the highest score, higher than hers. Why haven't you interviewed me. There is no power and no will but from God. Congratulations I don't envy you but it wasn't you who had the highest score.
Congratulations to us for passing the exam. I wish success to myself as well.
Rap forever.
Hayfa, may God guide her.
Hi, how are you, I love Hajar, Ahmad, Farah, Badrou, Hajar, and Ahmad, they're the stars and Yosra is rancorous and selfish
What is the presented problem?
Is university really a waste of time?
There is problem with artists and even organizing committee. Shame on them for the absence of Amazigh music.
Hi! I am Amir Ait Braim. I passed the baccalaureate and I am looking for language tutoring schools especially English and French. I want schools in Marrakech. Thank you!
Salam alikum. I am a student, 18. I passed the baccalaureate in SVT without honours. I would like to study at university but don't know which university in Tangier.
I would like to know which subject to study to complete my studies. Praise be to God I am brilliant in all subjects but I want some advice to study a good and successful subject.
I just passed the baccalaureate. I want information about schools, institutes or sites.
Saida Fikri congratulations for meeting with the fans after a long absence. You are an authentic Moroccan and proud of your identity.
Saida, may God protect you. That is all.
I passed the bac but don't know what to study. If you have experience, please help me and help all students who need help. You will be highly rewarded! Thank you!

This is a nice topic but it's incomplete. We want more information. Thank you.
May God protect youuuuuuuuuuu!
The proverb says, my brother and I are against my cousin, and My brother, my cousin and I are against the enemy. This is an initiative of the star, and we have to encourage them a lot even if it's not better than Lebanese star which succeeded thanks to Arab Maghreb students. I encourage Maghreb star and wish them success
Hi, I wanted to thank you for this great achievement of Nessma channel, my greetings to Hajar, Ahmad and Farah I would like to say to Hajar that you've honoured Morocco, work harder you and Ahmad
Viva Moamer Kadhafi! Libya will become like Iraq ruled by Jews. Ok, times will show this. France has just come there because it has interests. Why hasn't it gone to Tunisia? Because Tunisia has no oil, ok. Bye Arabs of Libya, you were eaten by the wolf. Viva Kadhafi!
He lived as president and died as president. You have disfigured the image of Arabs!
I am happy to hear this news. Many congratulations to the Libyan people for this victory they have achieved.
The most important thing is to pass, brothers.
Salam alikum. In my opinion, the body is not the source of the beauty of women. It is a source of diseases that's all. Everyone has his own opinion.
very nice program... in spite of you, you Lebanon you racist
Always Hajar and Farah, Hajar are you from Casablanca or Laayoune, I really want you to sing in Sahraoui 'Hasna o ya laila' I love you, with success to all participants

May God reward you with all the good! I need the address or phone number of an institution or association in Fez; I have a huge problem with my husband. Thank you very much. Please, I'm waiting for your answer!
God is sufficient for me and He is the best disposer of affairs!
Salam alikum. May God reward you with good everyone!
In reality, the support of the messenger of God, peace and blessings of God be upon him, should be by following his way not through killing and destruction. We have to seek self-constraint and not allow anyone to provoke us. This is what they want. Honestly, our situation is miserable. O Lord soothe us and enlighten the path of truth for us!
Infidels want to stir sedition. This is what happened. We shouldn't act in a blind way. We must know how to support our noble messenger.
Oh Lord help everyone!
By God we are just wasting time! We have asked you to help us but you didn't reply positively or negatively! We need so much this project to manufacture cotton. I will assume all responsibility.
you're nice
I am a young girl. My name is Laila. I am 20. I am looking for a job. I have a diploma in hotel catering. May God reward with all the good anyone who wants to help me!
I was working as assistant in a pharmacy. Now I am jobless. I want to work. I live in Olefa.
We heard that we must have ambition, a meaning and goal in our life. Is this true? If we really have this, why haven't we reached any result. Work is tremendous but the salary is low. Do they want to destroy our lives? They reach high levels but we don't. They are living a better life even if we are the ones who work in the country. If this is our fate, what would be the fate of our sons? We have Islam we must be righteous because we know the outcome.
O people, fear God about young people! Enough favoritism, give everyone his right. It will be counted as a good deeds. We would like to know to whom address complaints after God the Almighty.
I would like to work in any country as a house maid.
By God, you are all hypocrites because we aren't sincere.
Eh Moroccans, how dare you talk about Algeria? Catch up with it, then you can talk. We don't care about you, we don't give you a value, ok. It is also a big pleasure that you don't like us.
I want to participate in this competition, is it possible to get acquainted and is it possible to talk? I want msn.
Salam my brothers and sisters. Thank you for this topic but honestly, it is a shame by God. With the will of God, my sons will bear a name 100% Berber whatever happens even if I would have to go to the authorities, I will do it, but everyone is free to choose the name of his child as far as I know we are free and will remain free, Hmd, that's it, thanks.
Kadhafi the donkey.
You have exaggerated my brother Rachid. You have lived in poverty, this is not a problem. God has endowed you with his graces, who is like you now! You want to achieve your goals, but you don't care at the expense of whom. This is not your right. You have become very arrogant, God granted you His bounties but you didn't thank Him. Do you know that there are people who work for 50 dirhams, are happy with that and thank God? You are envious. You envy your brothers who are rich. May God help them! How many diplomas do you have? There are some people who have diplomas equal to your life. However, this doesn't mean if you have a diploma and are jobless, you can destroy the country. You too, if you were in the place of someone of them, what would you do? May God protect our king! Viva the king 99999999999999999999 times! Viva Morocco! God, the nation and the king!
I love Sidi Lakhdar.
I am a native son of Sidi Lakhdar. Long live Sidi Lakhdar and its people especially Hgagna, Ahmed El Gane, Rabie the mechanic. It is a pleasure. I am a son of Sidi Lakhdar.
Thank you for the news you post about this valuable event.
You should be happy that you take my time when I look at your pictures and listen to your songs. You should be happy with that nice privilege. Italy 21/06 /2008.
Hi, I am Ahmed. Oh Meryem, what a sweet and nice voice, feelings and melancholy you have. This is only present in the Taurus….
Yes, I am not yet relieved but I won't be relieved until I see the face of this beauty. Ok, I love you.
I die for our country Morocco and I am jealous for it as a Moroccan citizen. So please, we ask the government to pave ways, protect disabled people and grant them their rights. Thank you! This is because we vote for our candidates but without any result. The same scenario is repeated.
I'm a student. Tomorrow I will sit for the exam. I am very stressed. I hope I will take this exam without problems with supervisors. I ask correctors to take into consideration what students went through all year long, including staying up late. I wish success to all Moroccan students, God willing! I thank everyone who works on this interesting site! Timo.
This phenomenon has become very common recently in the city of Tetouan. They say that we have to reach Spain in order to find a job, a place where to live. A decision has to be taken by all the peoples to counter this phenomenon. because what they do is not right and risky to the lives of those who want to go to Spain. I ask every citizen not to put his life in peril because even if you reach Spain you will not have a quiet living….
I live in Tifelt. I need the help of the state.
1, 2, 3 viva Algeria! God willing 2-0, oh Lord.
I think that this decision is very good and supports young people.
Hi all Maghreb people. I am Hajar from Casa, I want to tell you I am crazy for the academy, Maghreb star academy but they don't keep their word like the Middle East star academy, for example Hajar, what did they give her, nothing.
I am 14, I can sing and have a voice. I hope to participate with you, ok?
I am crazy for Hajar, the first star, because firstly her name is like my name, and secondly she is Moroccan and was there, she was the most beautiful girl. She was honouring Morocco and I hope that this year as well there will be Moroccan girls like her in beauty and even in the voice.
I liked very much these articles about road accidents in Algiers. Therefore, we mush stop high speed which is present now in our country. I advise all drivers to reduce speed.
RAJA is my life. What will you do in the derby?
I am one of the fans of Star Academy and want to see the second edition of Star Academy Maghreb.
For these two channels ****, I think that they should be removed from existence and those who supervise them. They have never talked about the problems of the people. Between us, we don't expect them to do that. They swallowed monies of the people. God awaits but doesn't neglect. Sniper Oujda.
I've been an employee of a private urban transport firm since 10/2004. I was registered at the National Fund for Social Security in 01.04.2005 under no *********. But to this day, I haven't received any allocations. What should I do? By the way, the company intentionally renews employment contracts every six months. To this day, I haven't signed any contract.
Raja forever, Greens forever, Rajawi forever!
Happy Eid to lords of the faith who live in luxury while their people die of hunger. Is this Eid, people, or a reminder of the accountability expecting you? Fear your lord.
Peace of God be upon you. My name is Brahim Sagawi from the city of Erfoud in Morocco. I play in the club of Raja Erfoud in the left wing. I hope from God will develop my football skills in the academy of his majesty the king. May God reward you with good! Thank you!
I want to thank the people behind this site. As a Moroccan citizen, I feel like there is a [unintellegible] about the Moroccan Sahara. I want to say to the enemy that the Moroccan people and its leader King will never give up an inch of their land no matter what, even if the whole world rallies against this Amazighi and Arab territory of the African continent. You must know that there is no legitimacy to the so called "the Sahraroui Republic" indeed there are sahraouis just like Amazighis, Arabs, Jews or Christians...You should therefore fear your Lord, enemies of Morocco. We are united day in and day out under the leadership of our King Mohammed VI. The so called "Terrorism" has no place among us. We are up in arms in all places to face it. Long live Morocco and long Live Moroccan expats all over the world, including you and those working for you. Thank you
Wake up???
Why are you envious, the Sahara is Moroccan and always Moroccan, and even Algeria and Mauritania are Moroccan territory. Check history and you'll knew reality.
Liar!
Honestly, I'm crazy for all of your songs because whenever I have a problem and hear your voice, I relax. Honestly I don't know why I do this, and no other singer makes me feel better, because all your words are truthful and rai is the best musical genre in which you've chosen to sing. I wish you a happy and peaceful life and everything you wish. I don't wish to see you, on the opposite, I hope that your voice will always remain new, because your voice is everything for me, but if I had that opportunity, why not. You're the best.
I am a young man, 16. Football is my life after the worship of God the Almighty. I would like to realise my dream. I hail from Guelmim, the gate of Sahara. Viva the jewel of Sahara, Guelmim!
I play with the team of Sidi Kacem. However, there are no good coaches. I hope to play with this very nice institution. Thank you very much!
I'm a fan of the famous singer Cheb Nasro and hope to listen to his latest album as soon as possible. Nasro 2007. Abdelhak, long live Morocco Fes.
I'm from Fès and have gone before to Algeria. I like all the songs of Cheb Nasro and know them by heart, namely 'Makam Samira', 'Rani Nghani' and 'Khasrin Lklob'….
I am a Moroccan young woman. I am married and I have been living in Italy for three years. Now I want to divorce. I would like to know if my husband has the right to take my authorisation papers of residence. How can I get those papers? By the way, it was my husband who brought me to Italy.
Long live the greens. May God protect them. Five in the eyes of the envious.
I am really great. Long live ES-Mostaghanem.
Moroccan rap forever, to the death!
My daughter has just gone to Italy. Her husband wants to bring her back to Morocco, divorce her and take away her papers. Please advise me and give me the phone number of an association in Italy as she is alone there. Thank you!
Fnaire, God bless you my brother! May God protect you! I wish you a good continuation. Well done, kisses!
What's right is right, no matter how long it takes. Don't be sad, Amazigh are coming. History is repeating itself.
Moroccan rap forever!
We are Amazigh people. Our country is Morocco. Our king is Mohamed VI, may God assist him. Long live the king! HUSA forever! I am Amazigh and will always remain Amazigh.
I want all the letters of Tifinagh.
These are the nicest Moroccan channels!
Congratulations, Antar Yahia!
Salam. This is just nonsense.
Morocco forever, Badou Zaki forever, the excellent goalie of the national team!
Congratulations, conqueror of Pharaohs, may God curse everyone who calls himself Pharaoh.
Hi! I wish all the success to the national team.
Salam alikum (May peace be upon you). Does this federation of Morocco want the national team? The president of the federation should be dismissed. We don't need him. In 2004, we reached the final with Zaki. In 2013, they brought Rachid Taoussi. He can do nothing. We have players but we don't have a coach. Why didn't he call up Chamakh, Taarabt and Boussoufa? He brought Hamdala and Youssef Laarab, a player who missed four opportunities to score a goal. He should bring Chamakh. We have a player in Arsenal. He doesn't want to call him up. Finally, if the federation is Moroccan, politics shouldn't interfere with sport, this is clear.
Let's support the lions!
Welcome Taoussi in the Moroccan national team!
Salam. I ask God to send His mercy in the hearts of Muslim people so that they would be compassionate for this people and give an opportunity to Mr Zaki and we will see all the good. They should review his career with the national team and compare it to all those who trained the national team. But they should give a fair opinion. It is very difficult for us to watch our national team trained by a non-Moroccan trainer especially Mr Zaki. May God guide you, listen to us at least this time! We wish Morocco prosperity and peace.
I want Badou Zaki because he is the one who enabled us to see Morocco as it was in the past. Today, we lost Zaki. He loves his country. Why doesn't this federation like Zaki? Why don't you respond to the demands of the people? The Moroccan people aren't happy with this coach Twassi. Zaki forever and his sons, no team can defeat him! This is the slogan which lives in the hearts of Moroccans until now. I hope this comment will reach my brother Zaki. A message to Zaki from a fan. Peace and blessings of God be upon the most honourable messenger. I am a boy from the village Tililt Aftasse Imsoun. This village always supports you. On behalf of my village, I tell you go ahead, your generation made many achievements, be patient, the lions are yours and will always remain yours. Your enemy is our enemy. We are always with you. Patient is key to everything. We want you never to relinquish your national spirit you have towards Morocco.
Morocco forever! All coaches in Morocco are good. We just need some resources. We hope that the national federation takes this into consideration so that the Moroccan football moves forward. Thank you!
Oh world how misled we are, you rejoice the rescue of Moses, (peace be upon him), and you forget your prophet (peace be upon him), so strange is this world. Peace be upon you Hussein, every eye will cry on the day of Judgment except the eye which cried for Al Hussein (peace be upon him).
Salam alaikoum. I'm Moroccan and know the importance of the day of Achoura and I know that the important reward for fasting on this day. But I'm against the celebrations of Al Shia on that day, including the different dangerous ways and methods through which they express their sadness. God hasn't recommended us to do that. Expressing one's sorrow was and will never be through violence. Read texts about this issue, as on this day our master Al Hussein was a martyr. Our sadness is in our hearts and God knows what we hide and show. Praise to God Almighty.
Salam alaikoum. It's known that the day of Achoura wasn't the killing of our masters Al Hassan and Al Hussein, it's the day of victories which we should commemorate and celebrate…salam. Blessed and happy Achoura.
Go and be a volunteer in your army.
We support the Greens, whether they win or lose! Amir, 5 years old, and Zamen, 2.
Good, understood.
Hi. I wish to set up a project in building in Laâyoune. So I need an important funding to improve my conditions and profit Morocco as well so that Moukawalati becomes a big business so that I will benefit and Morocco benefits. But I don't necessary measures. Thank you.
I'm one of the students who sat for the second session of the baccalaureate, it's said that the results will be for today, but there's nothing of that.
May God curse you Moamer Kadhafi to the Day of Judgment! I hail from Morocco. The world is praying against you Moamer Kadhafi to God your Creator. You will be in the lowest ranks in hell. May God make you die with execution! I ask God to make me see your tomb! By God, I will make you naked and immolate you more than 1,500 times!
I'm yassin from Morocco. I want to thank everyone supervising the staff of Magharebia and greetings to all participants.
You are mocking the people.
Why are you weak? Morocco has surpassed us in everything. Do you understand Algerians?
To tell the truth, you're a real master
God willing the greens will take it. Go ahead greens, lift our head.
I say to these people God bless you! Can't you reduce nakedness a little? They are exaggerating not a little, but too much!
God's curse on you naked women to the Day of Resurrection!
This is what we needed, mourning for Michael Jackson. You should mourn for the poor who have nothing to eat. They should mourn for those who are in Gaza, Palestine. As to Michael Jackson, he has 100000000.
God is the greatest! (Algeria)
Sahara is Moroccan 100%. There is no discussion about this in spite of the enemies of Morocco. We will never relinquish it to the last breath. We say to Algeria, you have no share in the Moroccan territory. Let us in peace!
This is even nice.
If only the government of Algeria were honest in its words. Rulers of Algeria bear strong hostility to Morocco. May God guide them! They are traitors. Morocco is envied. The president of Mauritania graduated from the academy of Morocco. Now he is working against Morocco. O Lord protect us from the evil of enviers!
Assiham band and Nas El Ghiwane are great. They are the best bands. I love them for the cause of God.
In the name of God I begin... salam alaikoum may God grant him long life and protect him........
I want to understand more. By God, I haven't understood. I hope you will understand me. I want to participate and express my opinion. Thank you Imane.
Bassma is a star.
Thank you for your care for simple girls. Thank you Chazina and Chazil. Thank you, I am Sokaina from Rabat, Morocco.
BAD
Amimar so much- may God protect him and grant him long life.
I love Nass El Ghiwane and welcome them in Agadir.
I am crazy for Nas El Ghiwane especially their old songs!
Salam alaikoum. A greeting to Amar Ezzahi, he's the only one left in popular music. Best singer of all time.
I don't know what to do if I pass the baccalaureate. I need someone to guide me please! I am a student in the second year of the baccalaureate human sciences.
Salam. This is Wassim. My greetings to all Moroccans.
Hi! My name is Sara. I would like to ask whether we can apply to all schools after passing the baccalaureate. I mean applying to the same school in different cities or it is impossible. Do I have to apply only to the same school in one city only? Please reply! Thank you!
I think that this orientation is not adequate. I don't know why.
I wish success to everyone!
Salam. I am a student in the first year of the baccalaureate. I would like to choose the subject of agricultural sciences but I don't know why there aren't many high schools offering this subject. But why?
Are there really any prospects for students after the baccalaureate? I would like to have a convincing reply.
May God protect you Rachid. All your films are nice. Thank you for entertaining us this summer in Lala Laroussa…?
Women must stop this and cover themselves. This is because such clothes fascinate our Muslim brothers. God doesn't say this. Vice should be changed.
All the Moroccan government is 0000000
The best thing in the news, thank you my friend.
I am from the city of Taza. I practice the sport of running with Nojoum Rif Association, Al Hoceima. I thank my trainer Majid who assists me. I am a fan and supporter of Hicham El Guerrouj. Thank you.
I like athletics so much.
Thank you for this forum. God bless you! Pray for us to pass this year and to all the Umma of our master Mohamed, peace and prayer be upon him! I say amen, you say, oh Lord open the doors of heaven!
He performed his mission - Hicham lifted the flag of Morocco.
Hicham you were talented and achieved success. For me, you're the best athlete in the world. I keep your picture on my PC to always think about how you ran in competitions. When I run in competitions, I think how Hicham El Guerrouj runs in competitions. I too dream of being like Hicham El Guerrouj. Therefore, I say you're the champion of 1500 meters.
I am Mohamed. How did you reach stardom in athletics, especially in the 1,500m and the 5,000m? I hope you will reply to me.
Only God knows about tyrants. If he was a tyrant, there is a judgment which I hope from God.
I wish victory to the national team and I ask everyone to bring back Zaki oh please bring back Zaki, we want the son of our country.
Hi. I am Youssef from Agadir. I have a big experience in agriculture, everything associated with this field. I want someone to work with in order to show, develop and go ahead with my ideas.
Congratulations to the Algerians who got their baccalaureate in 2008. Good luck to others. You shouldn't lose hope. However, in Algeria I think that there should be a second session to offer a second opportunity for students. God willing, there will be all the good. This is Iman from Morocco, your neighbour. I love you. Good luck.
Zaki, you don't know who Zaki is? You don't know who Zaki is and you want success? We love our country, so fear God in 30 million Moroccans.
Zaki, Zaki is the best coach. Bring back Zaki, he's the coach of the national team.
Great, this is wondeful! I am from Agadir, Amazigh. I hope everyone will learn Tamazight. Wish you success!
Azul my Amazigh brothers. In my opinion, we have to get rid of small letters because they will cause us real problem.
Salam my Amazigh brothers in the world. I am an Amazigh man and I live in Fez, Morocco. I want to study Tifinagh alphabet. I want to know history of Tifinagh alphabet. Thank you! May God help you!
Salam. First of all, I would like to congratulate you for offering your help. I have one question. Is it possible for girls aged between 15 and 20 to have breast cancer? Thank you! I wish recovery to all patients.
Peace of God be upon you. I have colon cancer and will be undergoing surgery at the end of the month in the city of Rabat. I hope you will pray for me and for all Muslims to recover quickly. God doesn't waste the reward of benefactors. O Lord the physician is powerless, so heal us, o Lord harm has affected us and You are the most merciful! O Lord heal us and heal the patients of Muslims, o Lord of all creatures, amen, amen!
All these are lies. My poor uncle is sick. No one cares about him. Everyone sends him to someone else because he has no money. This is the reality of things. There are no free treatments whatsoever.
Concerning treatment in Morocco, there is no treatment. There is just robery and bribery. This is medicine of the state with which you are deceiving the Moroccan people, deceiving your state and deceiving even yourselves. This is a shame, a shame, a shame even for those who trust you o bunch of thieves! You say that there is quick remedy without any bribery but these are all lies. You are deceiving citizens and even the state o deceivers! However, every shepherd is responsible for his herd. Long live Mohamed VI! God is the greatest!
I wish all Muslims recovery, health and wellness! May God provide us with His protection, grant us health and wellness, amen O Lord!
I am hoping for a quick recovery very soon. I hope to hear joyful news.
Your efforts are good but if they are free of favouritism and nepotism. Thank you for what you provide!
Inchallah Morocco will win because it's the one that deserves it.
I am looking for a job. I have a driving license category B. Thank you for replying please!
We want to work. Do something for us or are you saturated and don't feel our sufferings? We are tired of the words we will soon find you a solution. Only girls are working in Morocco. You forgot men. Review the salary because it is not enough even for rental. So what about the living and health?
My name is Mostafa. I am 33. I am looking for a job. I have studied up to the level of the baccalaureate.
May God guide you to the good and success.
O Lord make things easy for everyone. I have a diploma in agriculture and a driving license (b). I have been working as petrol pump attendant in a petrol station for two years. Help me may God help you in this life and the afterlife!
Salam. I am a Moroccan young woman. My name is Meryem. I am 25. I have studied up to the baccalaureate level. I have a diploma in word processing. I need a job/ May God reward you with good help me. Thank you very much!
I am seeking a job as driver. I have a driving license of the category B.
I wish success to all the students from my heart with a good grade point average though it is no longer important in this country in particular.
Salam alikum. Honestly, there are many courses and more but this is not important. The problem us that there are not teachers any more who explain lessons. The teacher entered education through bribery. What teaching will he provide me? Will he teach me hypocrisy?
Salam alikum. I wish success to everyone.
I want to know success in Morocco. This is terrible. Success is the way to reach the future unlike the pupils of Tijani and Lrazali. The pupils won't pass if they remain in their current situation.
I failed in the baccalaureate exams. I didn't join vocational training. My question is whether there is a vocational training centre which still accepts applications now.
I wish good luck to the national team, God willing.
By God, Morocco is thrown in forgetfulness in football. Where are Faras, Acila, Hadji, Zaki, Dolmi, Bouderbala, Timoumi, may God rest the soul
I wish good luck to the national team in the African Cup, God willing.
Shame on you, why this act? All this for a 13-year-old girl who knows nothing and did nothing. Why?
**** you, makhzan of Morocco. If there is no Hashish where are we going to work? Where are the factories? Your 50 dirhams isn't enough.
Ha ha ha ha ha the gendarmes are thieves
Thank you so much for this interesting site for Moroccans...
In the name of God. I thank everyone who contributed to this programme.
Driving in Morocco is deteriorating ; therefore, in order to face its challenges, strict laws should be applied, corruption should be fought besides punishing everyone who receives bribery because when the citizen sees that when he violates traffic rules, he will offer bribery to officials and they will forgive him for what he did. So, he commits the violation and his conscience is at rest.
May God guide them to have mercy on us :d :d
Thank you for this nice site. I ask the officials responsible for driving licenses to fight terrorism so obtaining driving licenses becomes a little difficult and not allow anyone to drive, causing accidents. May God protect us.
Salam. The family code has brought bad things. By God, it is a shame for anyone who contributed to this corrupt code. It is not good for a Muslim society. By God, it is haram, haram, haram!
What then? Pointless!
Congratulations Libya!
By, God, I don't know what this will lead to.
May God rest the soul of Kadhafi the hero, o criminals!
Why don't they say they will give them visas?
Kadhafi is dead. However, he took with him innocent souls. I hope God will grant them a new life. My greetings to the Libyan people.
Kadhafi was a very strong man. I am proud of him.
I refer them to God!
By God, what can we say except may God guide His creatures!
Life is difficult in this world.
God is the greatest o Syria!
May God protect us!
May God protect our Muslim brothers!
Salam alikum. My only concern is that they run away to Tindouf and make an alliance with Polisario against Morocco. In spite of its military power, we will crush them then.
Morocco is the best country in Africa. But it is the country of real diplomacy because it fights terrorism, funding of terrorism, it fights the problem of funding terrorism.
What will I comment if I haven't seen anything?
I agree with you.
May God guide us and guide them God willing!
The country hit a deadlock. We don't know what the consequences will be.
May God protect Tunisia!
We are all responsible for the security of our country and our children. One single hand can't clap.
May God protect Tunisia, o Lord!
This is something we were expecting from a country like Morocco.
I just want to play.
thanks
Unacceptable!
May God protect Muslims!
Ramadan is the month of mercy, but with reason.
It is difficult to control love. It is easy to control deceit.
Will the English league be aired exclusively on Al Jazeera Sport? Good luck to Al Jazeera Sport.
a Job, may God forgive you!
If there is any good in it, may God bring it. That's it.
May God protect Algeria!
This is a shame!
May God help you Weld 15! All Tunisians support you, God willing!
Long live protests of the south. We support them with all means. A journalist.
It is God Whose help is sought! My brother, there is no power and no will but from God!
You definitely shouldn't come!! Country like my ear! You won't be able to focus or study, I assure you.
I hail from Tunisia. Is it possible to sit for the baccalaureate exam in Mauritania??
There is nothing in Morocco. There is nothing. Wealth is in the hands of the regime. Everything is in the hands of the palace. Morocco will become like Syria and Libya this year, next year or the following year. Anyway, toppling the regime is certainly coming, God willing!
They tired the chair, let it rest and let young people work.
I say that the Tunisian people are worrying too much. The government must find a solution so as not to reach a phase we don't want to reach. Second thing which should be focused on by the government is the living expenses. This means the basket of the citizen isn't enough.
I agree that there is no terrorism in Tunisia. It is just a rumour.
Salam. I come from Sbouya. I have a complaint against Mohamed Sanad Ould Najam who lives in Souk Thlatha, Sbouya. He encourages prostitution, corruption, offers drugs to kids, he (unclear) local authorities in Ifni and the governor. He threatens people. Everyone fears him. Is this right? This is a shame and crime!
Only God is eternal. We are the Umma of Mohamed. When are you going to understand this?
I would like to say about this issue affecting Algeria that the state is responsible for all this. Because, instead of providing jobs to young people by opening factories and granting rights to the youths, they are the ones who seek problems. I give reason to young people who engage in dangerous jihad because they see that it (their life) is going to ruins. Therefore, I would like to say to Mr Abdelaziz Bouteflika, grant jobs to young people. They are suffering. How can a young man like me not rob, kill or become terrorist?
This is not a solution.
The writer is one of America's agents. The second commentator, he is a malevolent shiite. As for the one who says "viva al-Assad", he is a criminal who likes Muslim blood to be shed. Concerning the issue of terrorism, it is a religious duty for every Muslim to be a terrorist against injustice and tyrants.
So nice, this is democracy!
No rest from the dogs...!
It is noticed that the good pensioner has planned during his work period on an income-generating project at retirement. Therefore, the government should pay back what was taken before with interests. Courage is necessary.
Why are prices not back to what they were before? This would guarantee the purchase power for the middle and poor classes and preserve their dignity.
This is good, thank you government of Benkirane!
No to Salafis in Tunisia!
This is not the right way for the so-called jihad.
God is the greatest!
By God, like Ennahda like Salafis.
It is so sad.
May God turn the infidels' plots against them!
Justice is free.
Our country is golden, made of milk and butter
May God not rest your soul!
By God, it is a shame for you to lie!
I am Atef Fazzeri. I have two brothers who work with the government. I hope to be with them in order to defend Tunisia and protect it. I say may God protect our country.
I am a member of the military institution. I would like to say we have offered martyrs and are still acting on behalf of our country. God willing, God will support us. We always say those who betray Tunisia shouldn't live in it. We are stronger than these traitors.
God willing they will accept me and I will become a colleague!
Bring us money not Khalifa!
We are fed up with lies! Every time they come up with employment programmes but we see nothing. They launched Moukawalati programme and drowned the son of the people. They make efforts for their sons leaving us to the streets. If you want to work, you have to struggle in direct employment.
This is 1 of 1000 who committed robberies of people funds.
Now, by God, is unemployment rate is really 9? Are you lying to yourselves or what?
If what is said is true, we certainly wish all the good because all our goal is to serve the country.
You have seen good for Khalifa.
9-11%, we shouldn't lie to ourselves. As to what is written 11-9, it is far from reality!
Salafism are Ansar Al-Din the criminals and they don't know religion. The ones who don't accept the opinion of Tunisians should leave the country of Tunisia ok, you monkeys of Salafism?
This is a good move. However, what is the definition of the youth category in the Moroccan constitution? It will help young people to move around, study and many other things given the scarcity of resources which are necessary for young people to move, hhhh, thank you!
If they have found what they want in Morocco, they would have served their country. Immigration is better than total death or remaining in this society that kills slowly. I am not at all against immigration.
By God, my brother Rachid you are inactive, you have of a coach only the name. You are stumbling, even Kharja, you are just floundering.
Shame on them, too much delay, stop it!
Free expression, free criticism but respectfully, not pleasantry, sarcasm and derision of Sharia on TV.
People of Tunisia free! No America and no Qatar!
I want Morocco to be happy with CAN.
The big catastrophe is Ennahda.
You terrorists, Islam isn't imposed by force. I am your Muslim brother. I acknowledge it. But Islam is not forced on people. You are terrorizing and killing your brothers in Syria. Go and lead jihad in dear Palestine and the great Jerusalem. There is no other God but Allah, Mohamed is the messenger of God. O Muslims, we are all brothers.
O people, o Muslims, fear God! Now you talk about terrorism o disbelievers and immoral!
God bless our army! They have protected us, may God help them to the end, say amen!
Forget about this country, this is not the country, it is going to be a desert.
Bourguiba has committed a crime against his mother Tunisia because of his loyalty to France whose army was unable to resist in front of the valiant mujahids and take young people far from the way of the scholars Ez-zaytouna which was re-opened. France thought and struck the country with its loyal son Bounkiba, so he closed Az-zaytouna mosque and undressed women. Here we are today still suffering from his corruption.
We hope our country will be fine. This is the most important thing.
First of all, the age of youth is very serious. Often, the individual regrets what he did during that period. It is not fair to violate traditions and values of the people for nothing just because you want this. We must as young people adhere to good values and seek what will help us go ahead not call for vice and immorality. No and a thousand no to nakedness in videos and no to pornography. This exceeds the framework of freedom and is part of the banned. Thank you! May God guide us and you for His satisfaction and success when we will meet Him and look at His noble face. The Ummah of Mohamed can't agree on a wrong act. This is a vice and we have condemned it.
The situation is below zero.
What Leyle and Hamze did isn't good and isn't nice. As for me, I call for their release.
Ok, we feel sorry. This Al Assad is inhumane.
May God protect you!
Ohh, if a war erupts, believe me, you will find me the first. This is Algeria educated in this way to war. You can rely on us young people, by God. Believe me, we all support Bouteflika whether he is oppressed or oppressing. We would die for Bouteflika. We would die to serve our nation. The military is coming for you O dogs! I mean where there is terrorism, we are always ready.
Jihad is a jihad in religion not in having sex.
May God guide us all!
O Lord guide young people to the right path, enlighten their minds and Grant victory to the religion of Islam! In reality, we are still colonized an indirect colonization.
Bravo my sister! I agree with you 100%. If they want to implement this, they must implement it for everyone. One more thing, the majority of young people do this and even more. Now everyone pretends to be a believer and does nothing bad!
This is not reasonable. Everybody has gone through this phase.
I say that they should be forgiven because they are still teenagers and young, they are mindless! They understand nothing. This is what I mean.
Thanks so much my brother!
May God help him, we all make mistakes!
I am looking for a job in any country.
I like facebook. Why don't you try it?
I tell them wait hen tell you receive wheat from Beja and Ennahda is not coming out!
Let him, they have all robbed with him! Go and find who were his partners and from where he had brought that money. We don't even have housing yet he organizes soirées worth 5 million dollars!
Animals!
May God guide them!
This is freedom they granted us a long time ago. Many things have changed in this country just with freedom. This is progress: everyone is free. Maybe this is the correct thing.
True, everyone is free in his life. But there are limits.
What is your definition of secularism my brother??? If you have read the Book of God, you would have known that Jihad is possible only with conditions. My dear brother, I advise you to read and avoid Wahabbi Takfirist sheikhs. Go back to the religion of God before you regret it!
When the country is in crisis, we wage a general strike, this is serious, now we have a failure, then we go to dialogue. This is really odd.
I agree with the opinion of the majority. Freedom of expression shouldn't be this way. Long live the Maghreb!
The reform means reducing the number of ministries and remove the second chamber, i.e. The House of Councillors. Enough wasting money! Leave pensioners in peace, they have enough trouble!
hahahahahahahahahahaha!
Salam. Morocco needs a highly technical player like Zairi, Bahja or Hajji. If there are any players like these, Morocco would be in a good shape. This is what it lacks.
Good
Corruption is a fatal virus. It should be treated from the roots.
May God help the poor people! May God shake the government and Benkirane as well!
O Lord protect the reader of these lines!
Jihad is a duty against shia.
Well done!
Why?
Peace and mercy of God be upon you. First of all, to the people of Morocco, we aren't Jews. We are Muslim people. We have a Muslim culture, thanks to God! We thank our president Abdelaziz Bouteflika. We are men. You were taking all goods from here. Algeria was a source of living for you. Everything used to go there including oil, flour, fuel and all goods and you are queuing up. God will reward everyone. We have one condition. If you satisfy it, we will help you Mohamed VI. Expel Jews, be a Muslim country again and fear God and we will support you till the end. Don't sell your country! Jews are controlling Marrakech, Mohamed VI, they are controlling you, control yourself and your people and I will support you.
hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh they are scaring us!
The RCD is a Jihadi movement that seeks the return of the former regime, it is the only terrorist movement we have in Tunisia. It commits acts and attributes them to Salafis and Ansar al-Sharia!
Al Qaeda is a malignant plant.
This is injustice.
You are accusing people falsely criminals! You're the most serious terrorism!
Good, the country will be cleansed a little from dirt.
These are dogs seeking to ruin our dear country Tunisia!
They killed him!
May God burn them and destroy them , o Lord! May God help the army and police! I hope from anyone who loves this country to offer help so that we will stand in the way of terrorism and terrorists...
This is not a way of protesting, God is sufficient for me and He is the best disposer of affairs!
Mentally ill. I think she must be going crazy.
By God, what you are doing is unacceptable! The country is heading towards a deadlock while you are watching and a new revolution will erupt in the country while you are careless. By God, don't let this happen in Tunisia. It is very dear in the heart of Tunisians.
The Umma of the inactive for 14 centuries.
God knows better!
May God bring all the good!
May God guide the Islamic Umma!
This is good, God bless you!
Love for the country is part of the faith.
Greetings to you! I am Kamel Amazigh Amadyaz. Long live the Amazigh people!
O Lord support Islam and Muslims!
Arab Spring has revealed a lot of chaos especially in our country.
I love her and I enjoy everything that was said about her. I hope she will cope. Thank you!
I sincerely liked Amina's behaviour. She says she is a woman and has no shame in showing herself as such. She says that history has deprived entire generations of women before her of their freedom. This is the story of Uqba Inb Nafil. Tunisia deserves better, and so do the Tunisian people.
You are an **etomane**. Go get some treatment.
I am proud of my country Algeria.
God, nation and the king. Justice for the dead, may God rest their souls in peace. They are martyrs. They will go to paradise, God willing!
God is the greatest!
Allah, Allah, Allah, Allah, now you see this, how would hell be?
Great, God bless you! (Y)
By God, he cries like a woman! She went to offer condolences to her family and she died there. She had a heart problem. It functions with the battery.
There is no problem.
Be one force, united people, one hand and there should be no traitors among you. In this way, you will take your freedom with pride and dignity.
I wish success to this government. He said young people would have the biggest share, I mean the new head of te government. Wish you success, God willing!
She should be in prison. What she did is not a humanitarian act, and I think that she has neither dignity nor personality. And if she did this for the salafists, they are not God. Tunisia is a Muslim, not a salafist country.
Salam. How are you everyone? I am a Moroccan national from dear Tangier to dear Lagouira. I feel sorry for what happened across the Islamic World. We should return to God. Bye.
Where does money go, o bunch of robbers! Do these people owe you nothing? Where is the money of phosphate as well? Have they gone with the wind?
Well said, my brother. These "progressive" people, instead of helping their country to progress, they are only retarding its development under the slogan of defending freedoms. They embody a terrible hatred of Islam and Muslims. Islam will win in Tunisia, whether you like it or not! It is truly unthinkable to see Tunisians pull out the whole package in order to curb the efforts of a government, which is still in its infancy stage. Give it a little time before judging your brothers.
Everyone is free in his life. She wasn't afraid of her family and God, how would she be afraid of society? This is the era of the glorious revolution and its product. I have a request. I would like to get acquainted with good girls. Send me an invitation. Khlil Belgacem, but not like this one, hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Long live Algeria! Praise be to God for this blessing!
This is very serious, but ultimately it's freedom.
Bless you! May God support you! The flag of Tunisia is always high, God willing!
Waw!! A surprise party!
Well-done! God help you and God protect us!
To say the truth, bless the army, the ruler and even the guards. By God, hadn't they come there the country would have blown up in the public place. Thank God, thanks everyone!
Follow the path of guidance, the Book of God and Sunnah of His prophet, peace and blessings of God be upon him!
In Tunisia there is security and there are men. There is no place for terrorism!
Tunisia is going through a crisis because terrorism and Salafists. God is sufficient for us and He is the best disposer of affairs against them!
God will support the truth!
May God support you and us on the true path!
God willing, God will support the truth, support Islam and Muslims.
May God guide you o Tunisians!
God willing, God will support the truth!
Let them come and dry up the country!
Anyone who does an act should be held accountable for it.
This is a wall movie, hhhh! They brought him to settle scores. Those who brought him are the robbers. They are sitting for Khalifa, they are hailing him, he came with conditions of strong people.
If only they would grant us the youth card too.
Our God is one, our homeland is one, our nation is one. Long live Algeria, Long live the nation! We are attacked in the dearest thing to us Islam. God is sufficient for us and you Algeria.
The one who wins the votes, it is the same. We consider ourselves that we will ultimately die.We aren't going to take anything with us from this country. They consider the country their property and we owe nothing. They take us to wars and military, enough! There is nothing to give us. That's all. God is sufficient for us, and He is the best disposer of affairs against them!
I support Bouteflika to death! Viva our president Bouteflika for a 4th, 5th and 6th mandate!
It is normal, like France. Let them live life!
Hh! But I don't understand how they arrested them or how they saw them!
Muslims have their moral values; Christians and Jews have their own. You have to choose!
The mindset should be changed.
With all my respects, I haven't seen anything done by this minister. There are no proper stadiums like in Barcelona for example. There are no efforts to integrate with international football and no coordination. So what can we call this minister, with all due respects to all ministers and with all due respect to Mohamed VI, may God grant him a long life! I don't understand all what is happening. I only know that people's money is in a worn out sack. I don't mean to accuse anyone, I am just talking about this issue.
This is impoliteness and lack of education. People go to the net in order to benefit not to distort his image or the image of someone else. As we say, one bad fish spoils the whole pond. This is lack of education. It is not because of adolescence or young age. We are Moroccans and we must be concerned about our country, be united and polish our image.
an Arab government is not considered as a government starting with the government of the Maghreb.
If they want to fight corruption, it shouldn't be through these guys. There are adults who do more than this. So, I don't agree with them.
These two teenagers must not imprisoned. They should be advised with reason and understanding.
Which law is this? If there was law, they should go to prison. What is this scandal? They think they are so alert! They should go to prison and should be educated because they aren't raised right. As for those who talk about adolescence, weren't we all adolescents? Why haven't we done such a thing? They have disgraced us, may God take revenge on them! All the shame is on that dirty girl who has brought shame on girls. She is proud of herself and posts it. God's curse on the shameless! In my opinion, they should go to prison, not just two years as I heard, they need more. Salam. May God protect us until we are buried under dust!
There is a lot of trickery, wake up Tunisians!
May God protect us!
I say this is a mythical story produced by God knows who.
What can I tell you my Muslim brothers, there is humiliation in this country.
God is the greatest! All the praise to God, exalted be God morning and afternoon!
This is a shame on him! Are these people not Moroccans?
By God, you won't succeed! Let people work!
And why are they doing this between Algeria and Morocco? We are Muslims, we are Maghreb people. This means Algeria, Tunisia, Morocco and Libya. Please, it is ok, we want peace!
May God help him!
Man, forget about these discussions! As long as the borders don't become too loose! This is too much for you O Moroccans!
Now you worship presidents, this is a catastrophe, by God! I have never seen people like you. This is a big shame, by God!
The children of France are the ones in control. We haven't yet achieved our independence to this day. My grandfather, my father and us paid the price. France hasn't gone yet.
This seems normal for you even if they let them do what they want. (People like you are the ones who don't care about Islam!)
May God help you!
This smuggle is called "contraband". We are with our people in our country, everyone uses it to smuggle cannabis and cigarettes to live.
God willing o Lord!
May God guide our children!
They authorize what they want and ban what they want. This is his country not my country.
I am a fan of HAMZOU BERAWEN.
Honestly, the one who commits a sin deserves punishment. We are in an Islamic country. It is a shame and disgrace to see such acts. For me, I am against what these young people did. This is one of the signs of the Hour. May God guide them! One should ask for God's forgiveness. Life is just but ephemeral entertainment. May God guide them!
It is true. We are in an Islamic state not a European one. In my opinion, they should be punished to be a lesson for everyone for this scandal they committed. They have distorted the image of Morocco and its people. So, may God guide them and forgive them because life is not eternal for anyone. This as you said my sister is one of the signs of the Hour.
Algeria is our country. We live and die for it! May God grant it security forever!
Peace is the easy solution for everyone and we support you Morocco.
Pretty good.
Thank you!
Who told you disbelievers o mule!!!
We have nothing to do with Morocco. We have our dear Tunisians. Keep your drugs there! Kingdom of prostitution! Kingdom of donkeys!
Release Hamzo Bryn and Leila Moulay. We want Mauritania to progress not go backward. Say with me I am not going to choose anything but Mauritania there it is in the bottom. I am Muslim, thank God. Let them, leave them, you're not the ones who are going to hold them accountable.
Shame on them! May God guide them!
All what you're saying is wrong. We are supposed to help each other. You think that when you carry your arm against your brother you are doing the right thing? No! You will go to hell while you think that when you die you will be considered a martyr.
And do you know how to interpret Qur'an? You're so mean!
Why are you doing this Tunisians why do you go for jihad in Syria? Do you want to die as martyrs? I would like to say this to everyone. You left sad families behind you. If only you waged jihad in your country Tunisia. This is better for you. May God rest the soul of Chokri Belaid, Ahmed El Brahmi and the Tunisian soldiers. We, all Tunisians, will stand for it, we rose up and now Tunisia is free and my country will always remain free. We are all with it, we stand hand in hand.
Tunisian young people should be aware of this serious danger which is threatening our young people and our country. This is because our country needs them more than any time. They should be careful about agents who come to spread their message in the name of religion for some inhuman or suspicious purpose. This is my message to all young people.
The best Cheb in Algeria.
Freedom is necessary in our private lives.
No, the border will remain closed and will never be opened again.
Shameful!
All these are lies! We are Muslims and want the implementation of sharia!
The Eid is tomorrow.
Well-said! Thank you! Those who betray Tunisia shouldn't live in it.
Algeria is interested only in football. People 2000 thinks only of the league or facebook.
Salam to all Africa!
Hhhhhhh, they did nothing! Hard luck!
We shouldn't lie to ourselves. We know who brings them in.
The Fund was looted and the poor pay! This is a shame!
God is the greatest!
They are prostitutes, no more and no less!
I am asking you for an application for this job.
God willing, all Arabs will understand that life is ephemeral!
Criticizing Arabism in the name of Tamazight was triggered by France (Massiniss). But it will supposedly be happy with you, your meanness and treason.
Reign is for God!
You're right, o daughter of my country Sihem.
Long live the army!
All this was not necessary! Mind your own business, o people!
Al Qaeda is the symbol of glory and pride for this era. Those who fight so that the word of Allah would be the highest, it is for the cause of God and the Sharia of God will be implemented on earth with the dignity of the dignified or the humiliation of the humiliated.
We want peace in Tunisia.
There is no government and no ministers, they're all thieves!
For me, everyone is free in expressing his life as long as this freedom doesn't touch the freedom of other people...
Prison.
May God protect us!
Raja forever, Raja is in the blood!
May God protect us and guide us to take care of our country! God willing, our country will be fine, o Lord!
O people, fear God! Sedition is torture! Look at Baghdad, Syria, Tunisia, Libya, Egypt, Afghanistan and Yemen! Shame on you to ignite fire in the Muslim countries!
Peace be upon our master the messenger of God.
Good! This is how women should be or not!
May God protect us, protect our country o Lord, protect us from the evil eye, enviers and from all evil! 1, 2, 3 long live Algeria!
I am optimist about it, there will be all the good!
God willing, o Lord!
Forget about Morocco and talk about your country. Viva Morocco, its people and king!
O people of Libya, be free men!
The French colonizer, the ignorant student! Crusaders fight Islam and Muslims in Mali. "But Allah will complete His Light even though the infidels hate it." Salutation to the national popular army, union is power!
People of the end of times! They say what they don't do and they do what they aren't ordered to do.
Well done Ennahda, go ahead in this way, God willing, God will support you. What the previous ones did cannot be deleted altogether. It can only be done gradually until we reach the safe coast with the power of God the most powerful. Salam alikum.
O Lord! Events in the country are unacceptable, people are dying. I think that those who died in Syria should be brought back to be buried in their country if possible please, their mothers and brothers are dying of grief, by God!
Salam alikum. I am a pensioner. I live in the outskirts of Salé. I have been a soldier for 22 years in the Moroccan Sahara. I was among those who liberated it. But ultimately I receive a low salary relatively to my hard-work and my living away from my family. We call upon the head of the Moroccan government to take into consideration our conditions because we retire after efforts which deserve more than 1000 dirhams a month. It is logical that an individual sacrifices everything dear, goes on retirement with such a pension while others are comfortable in their chairs and get many times the double of that salary.
I am the daughter of a Morocco retiree who has been working for over 23 years and finally he retired with a lower salary than that of the current military officers. This is unacceptable. The individual risked his life and spent all his life for his homeland and for the sake of God. However, the state must take this into consideration. All this for the sake of keeping the Moroccan military strong as it used to be in the era of Hassan II, may God rest his soul in peace. The head of the government should review this issue and take care of it because it is part of civil society. We hope that you as head of the government consider our demands. We hope that tomorrow we will hear about what we want in parliament, God willing, from Maryam to Abdelilah Benkirane, the head of government.
I am a primary school teacher. 95% of teachers go on retirement sick, with diabetes, high blood pressure and nerve disorders. If we raise retirement age to over 60, there will be a catastrophe at the expense of this "nerves" profession.
Go, God's curse on you Benkriane!
I wish you bankruptcy... the fund of the people has become the fund of fraud, bla bla!
Thank you heroes of Libya! We are proud of you! The messenger of God, peace and blessings of God be upon him, haven't slain a disbeliever. God the Almighty says "That Kaaba be destroyed stone by stone is less harmful for God than shedding the blood of a Muslim." God knows better! Tunisians disown them o enemies of God, in the name of opposition. May God reward you with good o people of Libya!
Hand in hand to support our Muslim brothers whether they are Arabs or Amazighs.
May God bring welfare to all Arab nations!
God's curse on them!
I hope he is not alone, next one! God is sufficient for us and He is the best disposer of affairs!
May God guide and heal!
All these are lies. Time will show the truth.
Salam. May God help us and help all Muslims, amen! Thank you!
Yes, you're right. She's very sick by God's magic.
God willing, promises will be true and not like former one or as the new prime minister says he will give the biggest share to young people.
The national team drew with Cape Verde 1-1.
Lies of Moroccans to manipulate us, this was in the past!
God willing, this government will serve the country!
Tunisia is our country all. God willing, God will protect it, even if police are dogs.
Tunisia is a country full of debauched women. Tunisia is a country that shoots xxx porn films. Long live the Sharia and long live Ennahda!
Thank God, they arrested Abou Iyadh!
Taoussi, if you are looking for players, go to the second division especially the team of Racing Casa and ask for the best forward player in the youth team, Elhaoussa Abdesalam. Ask his coach, Mostafa Nahla, about him. He is the one you need in the Moroccan line-up. He doesn't miss the net. He knows only God and the net.
May God relieve you! O dogs, Abou Iyadh isn't a terrorist! Abou Iyadh is a lion in spite of any words by dogs!
You're either practicing Jihad Nikah, or they're using you! Or they have washed your brain, killing you souls untill this became normal to you. Who is the messenger for you? You have a deficiency this is why you put him in the rank of the messenger, hhh, enough ignorance and complexes! And if everything is haram, then why do you put your picture or are you looking for a man?
Salam, you are praying well for him. You must have tasted the life of mountains. May God not help you or him! You're killers and slaughterers!
Tunisia is the country of tolerance not a lab for microbes!
I am happy they have arrested Seif Allah Ben Hussain.
May God not grant you victory in this life nor the afterlife! You're the biggest terrorist o rascal!
We all know God. But this is not the way we're going. A Muslim doesn't kill his Muslim brother. If you weren't cowards, you would have gone for jihad in Palestine.
Don't worry! Do as you like! I support you. Islamist or not, humiliation is not acceptable in Algeria. You are causing sorrow to Algerians. The people are its father. Don't do like Sissi Hadek, the dog. These are traitors, be careful! Long live Algeria!
May God protect Tunisia!
May God protect us!
I salute the national popular army and national gendarme (special forces 8bb are real men!)
They are idle.
May God support the army!
I oppose even imprisoning them. This is because we see more hideous things, everyday in houses and homes. Yes, we must respect the religion of Islam. It is possible that these youths didn't act properly and were wrong. But they shouldn't be punished in this way. A reader.
To this point it has become important! Enough lies!
Anyone who does a kiss goes to prison! So nice! We want this issue to be implemented hh!
O Lord guide us to the right path, guide our young people and give Islam victory! O Lord have mercy on us! Freedom has limits. If anyone just acts freely, there will be chaos.
O Lord guide our young people and grant Islam victory! There are no more morals, no values and no respect! O Lord have mercy on us! We are human beings. God has dignified the human being. Freedom has limits.
O Lord support those who support Islam!
The religion of Islam is the religion of peace, love, co-existence and mercy not a religion of terrorism or hatred. It is the true religion.
Are these considered racetracks?!
Honestly, they deserve this for what they did in front of the people. Anyone who commits a sin deserves punishment. After all, we are in an Islamic country. However, they shouldn't be very severe with them and take into consideration Aid al-Adha and be easy on them.
How can we fight this backward mentality? They want to make Morocco like Europe or what? They should receive the severest sentence because if they do it and we keep quiet, tomorrow everyone will do it.
hh!
God is the greatest!
May God bring all the good for Tunisia, the hope of Algeria.
To the young people of Tunisia, fear God for Tunisia and don't go to Syria, thank you!
A kiss is an expression of love. What's wrong with that? If they were holding weapons, no one would have spoken. God is sufficient for me and He is the best disposer of affairs!
Salam. My name is Maria, I am 25-year-old. I am looking for a job. But unfortunately I didn't find any so far. I want to work. I would like you to help me, ok?
Does the state legislate the state?
You were trapped. And who told you to surrender, o thief? This is the fate of anyone who commits an illegitimate act. Who knows, you might be living in Harache prison like a king.
May God forgive you! Why do you ask for privileges? What about the one who has 10, what should he do?
Why don't Algeria and Morocco open the border?
Salam. I am from Morocco. In Morocco there are a lot of poor, O Lord help Moroccan young people, O Lord!
God is the greatest!
May God take revenge on you!
Every family or neighbours should report to authorities if there is anyone suspicious and be careful about children from psychopaths.
Yeah, we've all gone through this phase. But not in this way. There should be respect for Islam, not go out amidst people and do what you want. In my opinion, they should be punished. Peace!
We will unite efforts against terrorism.
Hhhh, you're right! But if things are so, why did you come to this site hhhh?
Very nice!
Great games!
Yes corrupt!
She wanted to convey a message to women by uncovering her body. This doesn't necessarily mean sex. This means that man can feel only his wife or his girlfriend and she accepts or not to get rid of the mentality that a naked woman means sex so that the phenomenon of raping decreases and man controls his desires through his mind, no matter what he sees, he wouldn't interfere with others. There are girls who wear revealing clothes and they don't care about men. They feel comfortable this way.
There is no Ennahda, there are interests. Everyone is seeking his interests. This is my opinion. The other is hell. I am against misery.
Reason should be used, otherwise a lot of blood will be shed. O Lord protect us!
I believe the government took this decision out of concern for the interest of the people.
May God guide them!
I love Morocco. Thank you!
I am a pure Raja fan. However, the final game was very weak. Raja should have scored a goal. Unfortunately, it has missed many opportunities.
Enjoy!
My dear sister, you are blind. You don't see reality as it is. All Arab scholars have sold their religion and Islamic culture.
Viva Kadhafi! Rats, rats!
God willing Kalifi!
This message is addressed to Mohamed, God forbid, you don't deserve the name of Mohamed! Morocco is beyond your reach and the reach of those like you! Go and see what Chakib Khelil did and he is still talking. Morocco helped Algeria in independence. How did you help us? Just trouble! May God protect us from you!
Efforts are made by the Maghreb countries to fight terrorism.
The games aren't normal.
Don't interfere with us! Why do you care whether we have means or not? You have no shame! Leave us in peace!
The situation in the Arab Maghreb is catastrophic. We all know that our religion Islam condemns terrorism, violence and extremism. It calls for spreading peace among Muslims.
Enough of this, nothing works any more these days because everyone lies, so please don't tire yourselves in trying!
I say long live Tunisia! I am a free Algerian. I love Tunisia. God willing, it will be safe and secured.
Long live Tunisia and Algeria - Ahmed!
Peace of God be upon you. Dear sirs, honestly, there are jobs in Morocco. So for those who don't want to roll up their sleeves and the others who don't want to study, we cannot do much. Don't be sad, God will resolve things. Good bye!
Everyone is free in his life. You have nothing to do with Salafists. Live and let live
God is the greatest!
What God says about it.
Well said, my brother. Helping each other and not pitting people against each other.
God willing, God will support the truth, support Islam and Muslims!
This one stole people's money. They will put him on trial. There will be nothing. There won't even be prison. We know the country.
These are normal words.
The situation in Tunisia will not change and there will never be any democracy as long as Ennahda party exists. The majority in Tunisia doesn't want a killer and tyrant party. In addition, it hasn't achieved anything. There was no change, quite the opposite, in Tunisia there is constant deterioration.
I wish Muslims pride and victory in everything they do.
May God ruin you!
Morocco and Algeria are the same. Just some people, may God guide them!
Woe to anyone who lies about you!
Just take care of the house. You lost your face.
This is not reasonable.
I like it.
Everything is fabricated.
I haven't watched the game.
This is unfortunate.
Well done Hafid!
An artistic celebration by all standards. We hope to have more of these celebrations which guide for the good. Thank you!
I wish to become a member of the security forces.
Right, master.
God willing, they will accept me in the entry exam so that I will serve the country and we preserve Tunisia from terrorism. Viva Tunisia!
I love youuuuuuuu Hatima, you are my favourite singer!
It is not part of our morals and traditions to consider this act as positive for the Arab society.
I am confused about which way to choose.
This is Jihad for the sake of laundering money!
What you say is right.
Salam alikum. God alone controls this universe not their chairs or their rules. The rule is to God. O people hold on together to the rope of God, His messenger and righteous Salaf (ancestors), they are the followers of the messenger, peace and blessings of God be upon him. Islam ordered us to act in order to reform the Ummah not fight for chairs and shed blood. Our religion is a religion of action not fight for chairs.
May God reward you with good!
You should watch before you speak.
Young people need money to provide for their family. You shouldn't keep on making fun of them: learn how to run a business and this farce. He couldn't find anything to say. Some told him you don't know, come we will make you starve! Will young people still study!
Protect your country o people, this is just arrogance. It is still my country even if it is unjust to me.
For 40 years now, there is no government which has worked for the interest of the citizen. These governments have always been adjusting financial crises of the country by increases and oppressing the citizen.
We are coming.
This is a good initiative. However, we must fight looters. We should not ask anyone we see to produce their papers, ok?!
Abu Ayad is in Libya and he is preparing to attack Tunisia again. He is carrying out big trainings in order to enter it.
It is required to hold accountable officials in this sector.
Saida is in the national 2 not 1. Correct the mistake!
Time goes on and on, and we still remain where we are.
May God blind you! About our country, they have all wakened up. Why don't disbelievers fight each others? Their eyes are directed here. Viva the intelligent state of Algeria!
Nature only allows animals to show themselves naked! But men and women must be wise and not question the power of nature because it is reason, law, religious values, and, most especially, personal consideration that guide our actions, not to mention the Sharia.
Azul– Yes, I agree with you. Everyone should live his/her own life. Okay, beautiful.
This is a good initiative. We wish it success, God willing! This is because most young people are jobless especially those who have degrees and university graduates. We wish prosperity to Moroccan people and youth.
When France first exported bottles of win to the US, they refused them because there was a drawing on the bottle of a woman showing a breast and eating grapes. So, are the Americans more Muslim than us?
Did God grant you the power of knowing His Divine decisions, even though this was not even granted to our Prophet Mohamed (prayers be upon him). No one knows whom God will punish or to whom he will grant His mercy. And to put it to you in terms that you will certainly understand (given your lack of tolerance) acting like this and pretending to know the final destiny of a soul is "cherck bellah" (the sin of idolatry or polytheism)
You have hammered our heads with these lies.
Irrelevant!
The must government must carry out all the promises it has made to the Moroccan citizen not just say words. There should be action as well. The government should consider the security workers. They should make them work 8 hours not 12 hours. This is too much. Thank you!
If Khalifa had come on his own initiative, if there was no one involved with him, they wouldn't have taken all this time to bring him and try him. They are playing with us as elections will be held very soon.
But he isn't the only one who stole. Where are other robbers?
We recognize this man.
Yes to Jihad!
Morocco is moving to the abyss.
They can do nothing.
Nice.
hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh, you can't!
May God guide you! You aren't followers of the faith of Mohamed, peace and blessings of God be upon him.
This is true, Ouldrabah. Thank you.
Well-done Beni Douala district.
This is not acceptable. They have resources. They kill a lot of fish, they can catch as much as 1200 tonnes a day. As for us, we catch 30 tonnes a day.
Israel is still making the chaos of terrorism. On September 11, it was Israel who did it under the name of Al Qaeda. It still wants to create more chaos in Algeria on purpose.
I hope these crimes, within the Islamic and Moroccan society in general, will stop.
Hi!!!!
Algerians don't like Tunisia. Tunisia is more honest than all of you. The Algerian is a thief. You trade in religion. Half of you are prostitutes. Look, you won't find an Algerian hypocrite.
Good!
Shame on you! Students of the marine study hard and pass but don't find jobs.
My name is Souhaila Bellikera. I loved one time in my life a respectable man. A good girl can be known from her face as Shakespeare said the one who is educated by a man, it doesn't matter if beauty goes or not.
May God protect Tunisia!
Robbers! No one thinks of the people, everyone thinks of his own interests. Do you think we are pawns? You are pulling our legs. You make agreements on your own. You think that the people are just on loan? By God, you won't find anyone like us, silent and patient people!
They will dry up the country and we fishermen we will be jobless!
The people don't benefit from the resources of their country and exploitation of their resources with the simplest means.
He is not alone.
He must disclose others in this case because he is not alone.
Viva Algeria!
Honestly, we are crushed by the current price.
The situation has to improve.
The biggest drug are snakes you have.
Long Live Algeria!
I like this site.
Praise be to God as everything went well. God willing, God will protect Algeria, say amen!
I can't find anything to say to terrorists except that God is sufficient for me and He is the best disposer of affairs!
If only they order him to work in Sahara, better for him, a farmer.
Long Live Algeria!
Everyone who fought for the Sharia of Islam, his jihad is correct.
What a situation, terrorism is a problem!
I hope anyone who does something like this will be punished.
Why is all this happening in our country today?
We the Moroccan people don't accept defeat and won't give up the Sahara cause and don't care about anyone.
To young girls, freedom is her right. She has the right to express her opinion. This is not banned. Moreover, we did the revolution for freedom. This doesn't prevent her from expressing her opinion in the way she wants. Thank you! This is an opinion, ok!
O Arabs rule with Islam!
May God help them!
This is not ethical.
May God guide everyone, we are all brothers!
O people, may God enlighten you, it is a game!
Morocco needs an economic awakening not religious.
May God protect Libya and all Muslim countries!
I would like to play.
You are right Kader.
Words.
This is good. However, when one gets a degree, they will need somewhere to work. There are many people who have degrees but can't find a job. This is the problem we face in Morocco.
I liked this work.
Viva the green!
Tunisia is ruined.
O Lord support my brothers in Yemen, Syria and Iraq!
Hahahahaha!
O Lord protect Tunisia and Muslims!
Our country deserves more, we should protect our country.
Enough scandals. This is painful for the heart.
Enough Arabs, what's wrong with you? You have become a joke.
Corruption has acquired weight.
Young people of Tunisia don't know the meaning of jihad.
Salam. I am Katze from Casa. Can you tell me please what are measures you require?
God is sufficient for me and He is the best disposer of affairs! You talk about all Moroccans! Prostitution and drugs are spread in the whole world. This is a serious accusation. God holds people accountable for calumnies they say about His servants. We are people who love our king Mohamed VI, may God support him. At the same time, we have no problems with the Algerian people because we are all Muslims. God, the homeland and king!
This sheikh is misguiding our young people. God will hold him accountable.
God, the homeland and the king. May God support king Mohamed VI. We support our king and our country to death. Viva the king! May God grant victory to our king! We will stand firmly against anyone who wants to attack our sanctity, God willing!
May God protect Tunisia!
God is the greatest!
I want to play.
What's wrong with people who think in this way???
I ask God success for everyone.
A very positive article!
Is this what you know.
Praise be to God!
I am Kamal from Casa. I would like to join you. But what should I do? Reply soon please!
I say may God guide us!
May God guide us and you!
I support BEN JEMAA, may God grant him success, may God support him!
I like Tunisia, it comes to us in dozens.
I am proud of you sons of my country. Fight for the cause of God and don't retreat. May God help you!
If only they would grant jobs to those who were before them. We have degrees but no jobs. When will those who will come after work? In snacks?
There are vocational training schools, but where are jobs? This is like "pouring water into sand" (Useless)
Poor Tunisia is in the hands of monsters!
Stop hypocrisy!
Not permissible!
I would like to fight and die as a martyr.
By God, this means this is a fabricated policy through which they deceive the people of Algeria.
God bless you and happy Ramadan!
There is nothing to say, it is the plan of God and action of the Arab.
There is no power and no will but from God. There is not much in terms of life. Today is the mundane life, tomorrow is the afterlife.
I feel sorry for you.
Morocco is ours and not for anyone else.
He deserves this, he should learn how to speak, the beast!
Bless you Klay! May God protect you! You are a man of good origins.
By God, shame on you! Don't worry everyone in Tunisia is with you!
BBJ is a master.
I don't like this, it's womanish!
I think Weld El 15 has the right to talk about what happens in the country. This is the least that was said by Weld El 15 to cops. Viva Tunisia and viva its great people!
We support you Klay BBJ!
Houmani, Houmani, Houmani, by God, it is singing your need, you're a master Iklay!
You're a tough guy Klay!
You know that police aren't dogs. Enough! They are men.
There is nothing of that.
Garbage
You're a man, you don't fear anyone! All Tunisians support you.
Shame on you! No to the government, yes to freedom!
Terrorism isn't intimidating as much as it distorts mindsets. " Indeed, Allah will not change the condition of a people until they change what is in themselves." God speaks the truth! O Lord protect us in this life and the hereafter!
I din't like this.
The best country in the world is Algeria. It is the second richest country in the world while its people are poor and all the youth unemployed.
Cheap! Salafists of Tunisia are better than this fool!
The Mawlid event is a celebration like any other.
You're the one who made terrorism and believed it!
Mean!
kings
What terrorism are you talking about? There is no terrorism in Tunisia. You have made terrorism with lies and intimidating the people with your corrupt programmes particularly Nessma channel where there are big liars Sofyan Ben Hmida and dogs of the Rally. You have distorted the image of Islam. Well-done, you did the job of professionals and now you aren't considered part of the Tunisian people. Salam.
Right, this is true!
The chair does more than this. Some were burnt, some were grilled. O people, enough hypocrisy or Ennahda which is still preying prople.
This is not odd, what's happening in the country is more dangerous than this.
There is chaos, lack of respect, lack of religion and education in the country. Moreover, the organizers of the protest consider this part of the backward mindset. Where is their religion and conviction? Or are they Jews and Christians? They are just seeking (to sow) discord in the country and be cuckolds!
Islam is the religion of peace and will remain so.
Honestly, I don't agree with what they did. They are free, they can do what they want. Moreover, of course we are a Muslim country. In addition, Tunisia, Egypt, Algeria, Morocco and other countries are Muslim countries but 95 of their women don't wear hijab. Everyone is free in himself. Moreover, adults in Mauritania are corrupt and young people are walking on their steps.
I would like to say to Ennahda that it takes power in Tunisia. O Lord support Ennahda!
Our country lets those who stole the money of workers and goes to do reforms in order to increase the suffering of these poor workers.
O Lord support Islam and Muslims! We are all brothers, our religion is Islam. Union, union O Muslims!
May God rest the soul of all martyrs and reform the whole Muslim Umma!
Let the poor man go! The honour of Algeria and all the people benefited. So stop injustice!
Justice for all robbers!
Police are cattle.
Police are dogs!
I witness there is no God but Allah.
This is a distressing moment in this country.
I think that there are no Muslims on earth.
May God make things easy!
The best solution in my opinion is to take a minister from each party. In this way we will rest of their faces next time and they will at the same time monitor each other so as not to rob, no one plays with the institutions of the state, no one appoints anyone from his relatives and things would go smoothly.
Salam my brothers. I endured hunger and went into a lot of hardships but found no compassion. Why? Because in Morocco there are no true Muslims any more, may God rest their souls in peace! Anyway, I came here to communicate these words. Morocco is free. I wanted to say that we should act like Sahrawis and do like Rif people. We shouldn't be afraid. If you feel that you are rightful, the day will come when you leave everything and go harm the world. We should be men, go hand in hand. We should only fear our Creator. As for this life, it is not God Who has predestined it for us. It is the rulers of our country who thought of how to make us forgotten. My name is Brahim Dawdi from Agadir. I am not educated. I am thinking of what might happen in the future. Don't forget that the war in Morocco is not obvious because they don't want us to see what's happening in real life. Hhhh, I have a lot to say! Next time! Be a man and don't harm your brother, love those who read my words!
If you want to succeed, you have a year long. Lucky you!
When a scholar in religion comes to talk about mercy, unity... etc, we insult him. But when we organise a general strike in the country which depletes the budget of the state, it is normal, a gained and legitimate right, it is supported by the union as when Chokri Belaid died. May God guide us!
You want moderate Islam, this doesn't exist in the religion of Islam. Where is Al Walaa wa Al Baraa? Islam is based on belief and disbelief.
They lied a lie and believed it. Is he the tyrant of Tunisia to arrest Abou Iyadh? What a situation! The people are like cattle! Anyone who comes fools them! By God, this is funny. They made up the story of Abou Iyadh so that they wouldn't leave. This is a lie to the people about attacks. If you want to spread terrorism, you are the terrorists and criminality comes from you. Islam cannot be fought. Be careful, Salafists can do more. I advise you to be careful about yourselves, o tyrants of the era!
Abou Iyadh isn't a terrorist. He is a human being who loves Islam and Islam in the Arab Maghreb.
Now all Tunisia is talking about Abou Iyadh the Tunisian, terrorism and are scared. By God, by God, by God, if you give me 20 soldiers well-trained from the commandos unit, if I don't expel these rascals you are talking about all day, put me in prison for life!
If it were any good, it would have been good for its sons.
O dogs! Viva Abou Iyadh!
May God bring relief! They say terrorism. I tell you that's how men are, by God men!
I don't see any religious extremism. I rather see rotten political police which is creating organised terrorism.
By God, bless you!
Of course to cover the truth!
Mawazine distorts our morals and destroys the future of young people, yes, Mawazine.
Viva Syria free!
By God these words are addressed to everyone. There is no terrorism and nothing. But they found it since the era of France. They're still in mountains. They are fighting each other. They are killing each other. Poor Tunisia, they turned it into a masquerade for the people. Poor Tunisia, poor Tunisia!
Exalted be God. "God wills to perfect His light, however the unbelievers may dislike it." Those who like sharia are considered terrorists? Those who authorize alcohol have become honourable? I say to Ali the ailing, God willing, God will heal you and bring you back to your senses, 17 years in prison, God willing, wouldn't have been wasted in vain.
God willing, o Lord, as we were liberated from France, these ones won't scare us because in Algeria the woman is a woman and the man is a man, ok, it is the country of dignity!
An excellent daring channel!
This is madness! Those who commit crimes are sleeping and those who love each other are in prisons! Is this law?
Ok, I think they took the punishment. This scandal is enough for them, poor people. In addition to this, they aren't mature. If they were really mature, they wouldn't have done this.
If authorities were doing their job and implementing law, we wouldn't have reached this. Anyone who commits a sin should be punished. We are in Morocco, in a Muslim country, it will always remain Muslim, whether you like it or not!
May God guide them, that's all we can say!
This is the solution. Anyone who violates law or religion must be punished. From a kiss to something else, to giving birth outside of wedlock to babies who will be thrown in the trash bins! Their acts are shameful! What a disgrace!
They found it as an excuse to commit adultery on the streets. To hell with them!
Algerians like too much Tunisians and Moroccans. No one will ever separate us. You are our brothers to the Day of Judgement.
May God guide us!
Nowadays we see acts of blasphemy, which are unfortunately numerous and common. Officials must do their jobs seriously without anyone's intervention. I say to these two young people and those who support them who have an infidel mentality, hell is the worst fate!
They are all traitors!
May God guide them!
Yes right, this true. All this is the deception of the Jews which they plot against Arabs because most Arabs are Muslims and Islam has come out from them. That's why they are distorting our religion.
These have gone too far. This is clear even if I am a young man.
God bless you!
I say that I want to work.
Weld El 15 is your master!
This is the country of humiliation. The children of the rich are working and we the children of the poor are told to submit our CV and go until they throw it in the dustbin while you wait for the job. You should recruit the children of the poor, they are lost with drugs and commit suicide. You should take care of the children of the poor. You shouldn't just look at the children of the rich. We are tired of applying this policy in companies "your father is my friend and recommended you to me"!
Anyone who commits an act should be punished. But he is not alone, you know them all.
He will confront power not justice because in Algeria there is no justice.
O Algerians sons of my country, westerners convert now to Islam in order to get the flesh of your daughters, your honour, while all you care about is your stomach.
Please prepare a report about orientation in the first year of the baccalaureate, that's all.
Shame on you, by God, to kill innocents! You claim to respect human rights while you know nothing about them!
May God strengthen you!
As far as I am concerned, I like this site.
There is no power and no will but from God the greatest!
San, freedom is my right now.
The Moroccan government is zero!
Algeria is always standing with its men. I am a veteran of the army. If necessary, I am ready.
WAW!
Mokhtar Belmokhtar, God is the greatest! Down with the state!
I want to travel.
I hate Tunisia in blood.
hhhhhhhhhhhhh their jihad is useless!
If they had reform, by God and by God, I would have supported them. Tunisia is free. Our flag is red and white, o backward, black like your hearts, ok rats!
God is sufficient for me and He is the best disposer of affairs!
Fear God, my brother, in your Muslim brothers. Why all these attributes? A word of truth about your brothers. Say who you are, then you can talk, o villain!
This means encouraging nudity. Shame on you for saying this!
Raja is an international team. Wish you all success!
O Lord I ask You by all Your names to protect Al Qaeda organization and Taliban. I advise the media of brotherly countries to fear God. By God, there is no glory without jihad for the cause of God and restoring the Sharia of God on this Tunisian land and you will see and hear very soon God willing!
Since she wants to do this, it certainly is not you or I who will convince her because she wasn't afraid of her family or God, how would she be afraid of people then? Anyway, I would like to get acquainted with good girls. Send us invitations! Khlil Belgacem.
(expletive)
God is the greatest!
Well done.
May God protect us and grant us security in this life and the afterlife!
God willing, may God guide His creatures to the right path!
I understand nothing. The world is upside down.
There is no God except Allah. There is no power and no will but from Allah!
Damn Israel and America!
God is the greatest!
123 viva Algeria!
I was very impresssssssssed!
May God guide His creatures!
May God help you young people of Egypt! Be patient, God is with us!
God will grant victory to the government over this garbage!
Well-done Khalid!
I love Belmokhtar o dogs!
God is sufficient for me and He is the best disposer of affairs!
Tunisia which is dear to us, may God protect you and keep destructions away from you! O green Tunisia, I die, I die for the homeland to live!
Children have nothing to do with killing.
I want to be acquainted with you
The situation is annoying, everywhere.
O dogs, our country is fine!
Who is the one who called them Jinns, o Protector!
Services 09 Blida.
By God, you have a problem o dogs!
God is the greatest!
I am a Moroccan young man from Casablanca. May God solve this problem for you my brothers!
hhhhh, what a stituation is this?!
Viva USMA and a greeting to Beni Ani Amrane.
May God help you!
You are dying Arabs.
Our problem is related to our religion. They want to take us back to the pre-Islamic era.
They tell you to do something and then tell you who asked you to do so! Protect workers, grant them their rights stipulated in law! Grant them the minimum regulatory salary, let them work 8 hours like all the people. People are just patient.
You are paying for 39 ministers? You should have only 14 ministers, then put the remaining money in the pension fund. The solution will thus be solved. Or you consider only what the poor has while others are looting funds of Moroccans and smuggle them abroad and pensioners are watching them!
I apologize for the disturbance. Everything is corrupt in this country. You should find some solution to help us secure a living. As for this, we are tired of it. You haven't thought of these unemployed people. You just thought of yourselves. Anyway, I apologize, but you are all corrupt. One can do nothing with these thieves. Hell is your fate. Good-bye!
God willing, he will be rested and we will rest a little from this stress in which we are living!
All these are unnecessary statements.
Salam. I am Khadija. I am one of those involved in women issues. I teach women. Unfortunately, there is no interest in this regard in terms of financial or moral support. Things aren't as we have expected them. Even in the environment where we teach, sometimes we have to rent the place where we will teach. As for the salary, it doesn't exceed 1000 dirhams every three months. So do we really care about women?
Benkirane, you show every day your incapacity. Since you took hold of this government, we have been experiencing hardships. May God attack you along with those with you! May God take revenge on you! You're just good at making crises!
The country is going down more and more and people don't want to wake up.
I am Bessem from Kairouan. I am 19. I will be happy if I am accepted in one of the units of the national army to serve my country with love and protect it from terrorism.
He is a good person, God willing they will let him do his job!
Good advice!
1, 2, 3 long live Algeria! God willing its sons will always be alert! I love you my country!
To Habib Cherni– Animals are a lot better than certain human beings. And leave wisdom for the grave, as Jacques Brel said.
That's true.
Sedition is worse than killing. Returning to the Tunisian people, politics make change and transition to true democracy far from speeches. Only seriousness will be useful. Tunisians know better its whereabouts to Tunisian interim presidency. Elections should be held and consultations with civil society should be made as it is trusted by the Tunisian people. God grants success! This can be achieved through dialogue not batons, violence, killing, seizing rights and freedoms. We wish success and hope to learn from dear Algeria. I wish success to Tunisians...
Our freedom stops where the freedom of others begins.
The solution is to implement the sharia of God.
God willing my brother!
There is no other God but Allah!
Increase our salaries, this is a shame, I have 5 children, have cancer and medicine is very expensive! This is a shame, I can't provide for my children, I am disabled and can't work. There is no other God but Allah! Viva the king!
You have gone too far! Who are you? Who do you think you are? If you aren't up to responsibility, hand in your resignation with your pride before I.... you know, your hour is over. Men of the end of times, so nice!
Where are phosphate and coastal line money o sons of bastards! You only target the weak citizen! May God take revenge on you!
You should hold accountable those who looted the Fund not target the poor citizen who works hard. Ever since you took power Benkirane you have been adding to the suffering of the citizen.
They are all dogs! He deserves this, it is his right and he took it.
I liked this topic so much. However, it doesn't convince me a lot in terms of causes.
He is not the first perpetrator.
Salam. Long live Bouteflika! May God heal him, God willing!
People need to be educated in civic duties in order to know their obligations and rights.
All this is the act of Morocco.
Where are the rights of the people from Khalifa and Chakib, 70 billions in Switzerland and bank benefits...? Where is the one constitution 52 years from the independence, the frozen and flexible. 4 constitutions govern the people. All the people are under the Zionist colonisation and he doesn't care. Viva the army and people!
This is necessary for all Moroccans, they need awareness-raising.
I want the state of Caliphate.
Convict rather the police officer who grabbed Amina by her breasts when trying to get control over her. The crime is easily seen. The revolution faces all the setbacks which are leading it right back to the law of relation. The barbarism has not yet reached its climax because reducing an entire people to poverty is very dangerous to their spirits and minds.
God is the greatest!
God willing, God will protect you Tunisia! Long live Tunisia!
Why these lies? We Moroccans, every family has a sheep. More than that, today the price of sheep is lower than at the beginning.
We Algerians are greedy. As soon as he told them 17%, everyone hurried up to him. The valley has run for him. The greedy is defeated by the liar.
By God, they have confused us!
This is not a team or anything, tell Taoussi to bring in Hafidi!
Poor people, you are dreaming!
The end of everyone is very close. No army should be happy forever. The end is the end of all armies.
May God guide us! They are lying to us. They must all be held accountable.
I address my respects from Morocco to Tunisia and in particular to Ould 15. We too are rappers (BD-MAROCO)
Lies, he didn't rape her. She was insulting him.
Lies, falsehood... seditions of the era in the name of fate.
Al Qaeda was created and has found supporters. So funny when Al Ansar were among the fighters and the fought.
We are all one hand. No one will disturb Algeria.
Long Live Algeria, Long live Algerian Military forces!
Normally, this one should be executed since he is a big robber.
Nice comment!
May God guide them!
The government should enjoy the money of the people which Benkirane inherited. May God take revenge on you in this life and the hereafter!
May God strengthen your belief my Tunisian sister!
By God, I can't understand whom you should support in this country and whom you should distrust!
The government should be happy, they go to Jihad, they die and we will get rid of new unemployment! A good idea!
Anyone who wants to go, God will help him. What is wrong with you Tunisians? You talk a lot! Young people want to wage jihad with brothers and know better than us. By God, everyone should mind his business and leave us!
Victims of repression, they don't deserve this, it is society that participates in this!
Anyone of us has gone through this. We are all teenagers. Or we were all teenagers. I defy anyone to say the opposite. (this is idleness, they found nothing to do and arrested two teenagers). Go and arrest big heads, thieves who have robbed this country o hypocrites! May God's curse be on you! Spit on such mindset!
Thank you for this noble message!
It would be better for you to fight problems in your own country. Tunisia deserves you more.
Yes, I want a spare part plant to be opened in the city of Meknès in order to boost employment in this city. I wish you success.
It is God Whose help is sought! These are the big signs of the Hour. The messenger of God ordered us to go on Jihad for the cause of God. May God protect Syria, Islam and Palestine. Young people in Tunisia, may God forgive them!
Tofike not Khalifa (expletive) stop by God!
Great!
We are fed up with lies. I don't believe them. Let them there alone everyone 1 share 1 (unclear). You will be held accountable by God the greatest o beggars! You looted it, may God turn it upside down on you, God willing! God is sufficient for us and He is the best disposer of affairs!
Liar, liar, liar!
Arabs are only good for politics. This is why they haven't achieved anything. May God guide you!
Now, if you have no baccalaureate, no degree and no influential acquaintances, you won't get a job. We are the people who can't work. We are miserable people. We must work hand in hand and help all Moroccans, upgrade the country. All Moroccans will see in 2014 if we have made progress or we are still the same. Thank you!
May God support our valiant army! O grandsons of Benmhidi, Benboulaid, Amirouch and Boumedienne, defend Algeria, protect the country, may God support you and grant you victory God willing! We all support you with our hearts and our souls. Algeria is not just any country. Algeria is the country of a million and half a million martyrs. We are all ready to join them. My greetings to all free people in my country. Viva Algeria!
These are just words! All those who have welcomed him are robbers!
Who told you that young people of Tunisia don't go for Jihad in Palestine? Young people of Tunisia are always present for Jihad and everywhere. But now all Tunisians are looking for anything with Salafism and they don't talk badly about Salafism. Therefore, after your revolution, there is a lot of talk about them and this doesn't mean that young people of Tunisia haven't gone for Jihad in Palestine.
The efforts of France to fight terrorism in Mali didn't bear fruit, why?
May God guide all creatures in this world, o Lord!
I liked it a lot but it is very annoying.
I liked this.
victim
Certain!
There is no government and there is nothing. There is bribery, that's all, without hypocrisy. I am capable of confronting anyone who says there is no bribery.
Jobs, hhhhhhh, we hear about this issue in parliament and also in the constitution. But when it comes to implementation, we notice the opposite. Anyone who wants to join a public service job is expected to pay the so-called bribery. We are looking forward firstly to a society without bribery so that we can then move to the issue of employment of young people.
Salam alikum. I just want to note that the phenomenon of bribery has spread even in employment of young people. I was a candidate in the police entry exam over 25 times. I never received any reply although I know that I am competent and qualified to pass many entry exams. I won't say I have no luck. I will just say that bribery is one reason why such difficulties aren't overcome. Only two years are left for me after which I will no longer have the right to access any public service opportunity. I will be among those who will commit suicide in front of the parliament. I say that Mohamed VI declares banning bribery but his followers do what they want. Viva Mohamed VI and long life to him!
This is so sad. Our sons die and no one cares. They don't know that killing Muslims is haram. Their fate is to hell which is the worst fate. There is no one to try those who are responsible for sending these teens and young people. They don't fear God and the judgement day. Do they think that they will go to paradise by inciting Muslims to fight against Muslims for a hidden goal? Is there no one to complain to for saving our sons? Is there no rescuer? God is sufficient for us and He is the best disposer of affairs! God is the best disposer of affairs, God is the best disposer of affairs!
Unacceptable!
Shame on you, let the people live!
May God rest the soul of Kadhafi in peace! May God protect Libya, o Lord!
May God rest the souls of all believers, protect the people of Libya not hypocrites! God only knows that they were hasty in judging Kadhafi!
By God, this is unacceptable!
Where are we going to? Where?
They should be executed!
Fierce days are coming and their turn in hell is coming. They just have to be ready. As for us, may God grant us patience for our Muslim brothers, God willing, in paradise!
May God protect our country and our king! May God support us against any enemy!
hhhhh everyone is going his own way to reach power!
May God rest his soul in peace!
May God help you eliminate corruption!
It is you who have ruined the country.
May God rest their souls in peace!
The nicest thing in you is your eyes.
Yes to the reform 65 years! Lives are in the hands of God, but reform is inevitable.
We are brothers, it is normal we help each other in times of hardship. But unfortunately, where are Arabs? Where is the religion they advised us about? May God guide us! We are all from the Ummah of Mohamed, peace and blessings be upon him!
The acts of the Tunisian girls are not something normal.
If you're not happy with these scholars, be a scholar, o ignoramus! May God not bless people like you!
You know, Soufienne, I love you. You are my brother in all the languages of the world, even Arabic
O bunch of robbers!
In Tunisia, it is clear that they are the hands of Salafist monsters or Ennahda.
You are not a true Algerian.
May God guide you!
Libya is over! There is no more hope o people!
The people support Ben Bitour.
We have to protect Algeria!
God is sufficient for me and He is the best disposer of affairs!
Man son of a man, go ahead master!
May God protect Tunisia!
Weld 15 is a man and will remain a free man!
It is only Algeria that stocks in your craw. Die in your spite! Viva Algeria!
My brother, Weld 15 will now be tried in court!
May God help you!
We all support you! May God help you Weld El 15!
May God help you! God willing, the judiciary will understand your position!
So what are you going to do?
Infidels disbelieve in the Lord of the Worlds and they do not fear God, they are the children of hell, they have no honor.
Nice!
Ouata– You are just stellar! I too would like to kill them all-the people who drink too! Keep your feet on the ground, boy. It seems to me that in Islam there are faults much more grievous that Tunisians do all year long. But, there you have it: a woman shows a bit of nipple and it's the end of the world!? This is a double standard of justice. Look at yourself for just two seconds and take a look at your sins before judging those of other people. Amina is an icon that you cannot understand. She's 19, but you will never get close to her fight and her courage even just a little. This girl is fighting for Tunisian women-maybe in a radical way, but she is a revolutionary and she is young. In 20 years, you will see what'll be said about here and the political station she'll have. In any cast, what I hope for with all of my heart is for the Tunisian women to emancipate and free themselves! Ouch! I think that I said a bad word! I think I am going to get booed! :D
May God protect Tunisia from these beasts which are playing with it the Salafists. They have been all their life inactive and after the revolution, they found it ready, they announced Adhan in it.
I dare you if anyone works. You are fooling people!
The country was divided by its sons, they have burnt it all. Is this a country or an oven?
Normally, we should cooperate in peace in our country.
This is true and it makes sense. Regions of the south are poor.
Maissa from Algeria. In my opinion, yes, tensions are on the rise in Africa. But God willing, everything will be fine.
It is the Jews who planned this.
This is impossible. As for the king, he will seek the biggest criminals, a master in criminology on paper. My brother, have some shame for your honor! Al Istiqlal party in the south is a kingdom for Hamdi Ould Rachid and his assistants are ignoramuses. We want to change. By God, we prefer it change brings a man of peace, reason, politics and morals. Khalihanna Ould Rachid is better.
Long live Algeria and viva the army!
Whether the national Algerian team wins or loses we support them. God willing, to the World Cup! We wish them always victory.
Is there any army left when the war has no ethics? Or is there an army when the war is over?
May God protect the Maghreb!
There is no difference between Algeria and Tunisia except in the flag colour. We are one state and one people.
God willing, the line-up of the new government will never be 203 like the former government!
What makes her courageous?
They can't even agree on a president, let alone the government. Their problem is that this government is considered resigned. They like to hold on to chairs and the people are waiting. This is not patriotism.
Amina, you are brave. I support you.
Peace to the world.
May God bring all the good for our beloved Tunisia!
Everything is fine.
Peace and mercy of God be upon you. Why is each one of us Muslims walking on his way? We have to be humble with the manners of the prophet, peace and blessings of God be upon him. We should get in touch with each other so that our hearts won't be separated. O Lord unite us, O Lord!, O Lord!
Incomplete and very boring.
Fighting terrorism through knowledge. Wherever there is ignorance, terrorism spreads. In European countries, there are Muslims but there is no terrorism. In Arab countries, there is terrorism. This is due to ignorance. Islam is innocent of them.
Excellent!
1, 2, 3, Morocco and Algeria are brothers, brothers!
It is not resources which are lacking in Morocco, it is thinking minds!
Look at any figure from 1 to 73 you can take the decision you and 73 who contributed to reach your position with their allegation.
I liked this publication and hope every criminal will be arrested. This blood is denied by Islam. Our Islam is moderate. Anyone who seeks jihad shouldn't kill innocents. My brother, if you want jihad, go to Palestine and kill the Jews infidels who are every day killing our sons, mothers and grandfathers while the whole world is watching them selling and buying them.
So they are all corrupt without doubt. However, the problem is the ones who looted billions of dollars and terrorized a whole nation. The scandal is that they aren't held accountable and aren't punished. Where is the state? Where is justice? (Justice makes peace).
The government is excellent, we should be patient with it.
My God guide them!
All that is being said is lies. I know the media. It is a double-edged sword.
There are those who robbed a lot in my country.
Only what's right(eous) will last forever. May God protect us! All human beings commit errors.
This is the reality in Tunisia.
I am Moroccan. But I hope Algerian brothers will solve all these problems without violence.
All comments I read show that their authors ignore the reality in the country. Therefore, I say some manliness Arabs! Our country is violated. Its blood is shed so don't make it shed more blood. Give it some time for convalescence maybe it will recover.
Tunisia is one country for all of us!
Who is betraying you?
Go and sell yourself if you live without religion or faith! As you know nothing about your religion, it is better you bury yourself alive!
What you wrote is correct.
God has protected Algeria! God bless you! Glory and eternity to the martyrs, long live our proud Algeria!
They must be held accountable for this act. We are Muslims. It is clear they are from those rich families who want to spoil our society. Sons of the people don't do this.
Mauritanians are now seeking culture and artistic progress. This video they posted is progress for the country? It is lowering the morale of the country. They have made it for repulsion or fame. They are looking for financial support.
May God guide His creatures!
This is not a sound behaviour. They must be punished according to constitution so that such act won't be repeated by anyone who might think of doing it.
I tell them, if you seek to make this country progress, why don't you make progress in the field of science instead of the field of ignorance (singing)? This is not art. This is failure, its field are losers and in the world we didn't find a country which made progress thanks to singing.
They have to be punished to be a lesson for others. Enough depravity! This is too much! We are supposed to be a Muslim country. Even the atmosphere with anger is no longer as it was. Everything has become corrupted because of the excessive depravity. In my opinion, they have to be punished as was the case in the era of king Hassan II.
This is a pudding! Everyone is singing his own way and replying to himself. So nice for the citizen!
My brothers, everyone works per hour or day except drivers who work day and night for free!
We are tired of looking for a job in this Morocco. No one helps you or grants you a job. This is a pity. Honestly, this is very painful.
Mercy!
I got nothing to say. God guides those He wants, He knows everything and He is capable of everything against anyone who wants evil for Tunisians. This is why there is internal terrorism.
O Lord relieve the Muslims of distress and protect them o Lord!
This is too much. I hope the country will advance and move ahead.
O Lord support Islam and Muslims!
You will not understand.
Praise be to God, thanks to God and for Mohamed as prophet and messenger.
Make more projects!
I thank God.
May God guide His creatures!
When Chokri Belaid died, Habib Bourguib Avenue was filled up. But before that, when the border guard officer died, Habib Bourguiba was empty and now it is empty. Where are human right activists and lawyers while those who condemn terrorism are still sleeping?
Yes, I like it.
We hope to see peace everywhere.
Hhhh, what are you doing?
Leila the cursed, we ask God to help her, guide us and her to the right path!
This is a shame, do they have no shame? I tell them God is our mandate, you're not humans!
This is a shame!
What if this happens again?
God is the greatest! O Lord destroy the enemies of religion, destroy Bachar and his followers, amen!
The nicest site!
May God support Islam and Muslims! May God protect our sheikhs!
The government drowned us with statements. But we saw no action. Jobs are granted to outsiders. As for us, you know us only in water and electricity. Don't you want God's guidance? Hospitals are overcrowded, and people are in the streets!
Benkirane, you have ruined us and divorced us from our wives because of this increase. Thank God, there is God. God controls what you do, this is haram!
The promotion of virtue is the duty of every adult Muslim. Anyone doing vice should be denied even with the heart.
God is the greatest!
May God offer us an easy and bountiful living!
Isn't Benkirane satisfied with 30 years of work or even more for the individual to increase two years?
Because Benkirane doesn't work very hard.
They represent criminality not Islam.
We poor people can't pay this tax 3000 dirhams, 1000 dirhams increase in tax, this is a shame!
You get a salary of 3000 dirhams and you pay a tax of 3000 dirhams, what will you live on? Stones?
Moroccans must grant some time to this government. There are those who have been in power for a long time without achieving anything.
God's curse on the bunch of robbers who kill the poor under their shoes! Repent to God o Jewish people!
Why are only major cities in Algeria that host projects? Are other provinces counties of Israel?
Oh in Algeria there is only the capital? O smart guys, there are 48 provinces. So be a little fair! God is our mandate against you!
Your goal is to distort Islam. Terrorism isn't associated with religion. Terrorism comes from Christians and Jews who kill children in Ghaza and Iraq. Poor countries, they divided them. They're behind everything that happens in the world. Their goal is to divide Arab Muslim countries to small parts so that they wouldn't have a unified word.
Everything is nice. But only when we put this increase in our pockets, we will believe it because this government wants to work. If it goes, another one will come and take you back.
Why doesn't the "Islamic State'' go and shell Israel???
Salam. I work in an orphanage. They pay us 1500 dirhams. I am divorced and have one daughter who studies in the baccalaureate. It is a humanitarian association that pays us. We also wish to have a good salary to offer good education to our children.
FLN has gone. God's curse on Satan!
It is true my sister, I hope things will improve.
In the sector of agriculture, there is real chaos. There are some who are paid 50 dirhams a day. Is this a life? Where are labour inspectors. They take envelopes to contribute to the richness of patrons. Is this right? O Lord this is a vice!
By God, they won't do anything in it!
ٍShame on you! You've gone too far o people! We know and are aware. However, we're worried about our king who is surrounded only by wolves and hypocrites. May God support him against them!
Salam. There are still some companies who report only 2300 dirhams as your salary and pay you 3000 dirhams. What's the solution with them? If you speak out to them, they will tell you 'go away!'.
You filled the country with your hypocrites, if you're really people of Islam, then you're all informers!
You say Islamists and similar things. I will ask a simple question. Do you like law in our country? This is one "And whoever desires other than Islam as religion." Is this one envying you o people? May God protect us, God willing! As Ali Ibn Abi Taleb, may God be pleased with him, said "If the righteous people kept silent about the wrong people, the wrong people think they are right." This is what happens in our country.
God's curse on them, they don't represent Mauritania!
Algeria is strong! No one scares us. The statements are true. A salutation to one million and half a million martyrs! Viva Algeria!
May God protect our country from these evildoers!
They are fooling people! There are no radical solutions, just temporary solutions.
We pin great hope on Benkirane government.
I agree with you, all Morocco for the youth employment to avoid unemployment.
We hope this is true.
The government was uncovered and can do nothing to these people except false promises to serve its interests. Up to now, we haven't seen any change or progress even small in any field. Benkirane is a mistake which won't be repeated. He should leave and let the people who can make this country move ahead. Enough promises!
The government is capable of doing more but this requires more time.
Algeria is my country, it's dwelling in my heart. 1, 2, 3 viva Algeria!
ISIL is an Israeli Zionist institution.
I wished the claim of responsibility would be supported with sound and picture (video) not just a statement which cannot be reliable officially or legally.
Belhadj, they don't like him, why Ali?
Honestly, we love Cheb Bilal. We consider him one of us. He is a respectable artist and deserves all respect.
It is possible to eliminate terrorism in one case: 1- eradicate poverty; 2- eradicate ignorance and illiteracy; 3- establish a nucleus of a strong national army which has a clear military base; 4- enact a law punishing severely those who supported, incited and carried out terrorist acts inside and outside the country. But on top of all this, understand the game of terrorism in international relations.
It is a shame on you! If you are really concerned about those who are owing something, the government was exiled, was in prison and wants to exile our youth! Wake up! If you want to hold someone accountable, hold yourselves accountable first o government and hold Ben Ali and his wife accountable.
We all support Bouteflika till the end of the world.
Before spending, why didn't they freeze the assets of Ben Ali and Layla in Tunisia? A government of shame!
Vote for Bouteflika, 100% powerful! 1, 2, 3, viva Bouteflika!
May God guide these rulers who don't fear God!
Viva Bouteflika! He will take it. So calm down enviers, spit on you!
Do jihad with your families first! Don't kill your Muslim bothers! Anyone who fights his Muslim brother, they are both in hell. So fear Your Lord!
For Salafism which they want to bring, I tell them may God guide you!
Viva Bouteflika, whether you like it or not!
I hope all the middle-class will benefit from social housing at affordable prices.
There is no Al Qaeda (sitting) or standing! Anyone who thinks he can cause evil to Tunisia must be mad!
These are all lies and war on Islam. If only they implement development projects and boost the situation of the country because God has offered them bounties. But They are fighting the religion of God and in mosques. The state is in a mess.
Yes, I fully encourage them and without discussion. God willing, they will forgive us for their great efforts to protect their people and dear homeland. Viva Tunisia and long life to them to protect it!
Some imams appointed by the former government are more dangerous than Salafists.
God, the homeland and king! O Lord support Islam and Muslims!
God bless you!
Viva Bouteflika! I support him to death!
This is it, God willing, it won't be opened, you don't owe it to us or owe you anything! Leave us in peace! Forget us! We have enough trouble! God willing, it won't be opened!
May God bring all the good!
May God rest souls of all Algerian martyrs!
These are lies.
Hhh! These teachers are insipid! They are struggling for the retirement age to rest while they are the most avid class! They go on retirement then go to work in the private sector. What we see in this country is a shame, by God!
Ibn Khaldoune said Arabs agreed never to agree.
O Lord show him falsehood and guide him to avoid it, amen!
May God bring all the good for candidates!
The man amongst you should tell me where Bouteflika is or if he knows it is enough, then he can say yes to a fourth mandate!
Mohamed 6, o Lord show him the truth and guide him to follow it!
In the name of God the most gracious the most merciful. O Lord support our Mujahid brothers in Syria, Iraq, Palestine, Chechnya and all parts of the globe o Lord of the worlds!
May God guide us and guide all Muslims!
I would like to understand why we are begging this Algeria as if it will supply us with water or foot! You should ignore anyone who ignores you.
Viva Mohamed VI! Anyone who seeks to destabilise our dear country will see woes with the slogan God, the homeland and the king. I love you my king. May God protect you, just give us arms and we will relieve you from ISIS, Polisario and even Israel if our king wishes so!
America the sponsor of peace (O God), woe to the friends of the demon from the Judgement Day!
I was in a place in Fez and saw someone give leaflets to someone else. But I don't know what it was. That was in Hay Imam Ali in Fez.
These are signs of the Hour.
This is nonsense. This minister is just saying nonsense.
I really like Bilal so much. He is right! May God protect Bilal and increase people like you! Real men are like this! We support you. God willing, we will all be brothers! Thank you very much Bilal!
I love Cheb Bilal so much. I hope his recommendations will be carried out by Moroccans and Algerians.
God willing, may God help you Tunisians!
There is no terrorist in Morocco like the government!
O Lord make Morocco always safe and peaceful! May God keep away anyone who wants to attack the Moroccan sovereignty! Morocco is the country of security and tranquillity.
May God protect Morocco and make it always peaceful, amen!
A salutation to my Egyptian brothers, you're heroes!
Anyone who commits a misdeed will be filed on the record.
If you have the guts, just go! Azrael is waiting for him!
I will sum up this insolence in two words "the one who reaches his ear can bite it!" What do you think we're doing? God, the homeland and king!
We don't know what to say. Ideas are absent given that there is a minister who is not good in debate. We need so, so much. Enough for us is the continuous increase in foodstuffs, that's all!
Praise be to God for the grace of security granted to us by God here in Morocco! We don't have anything but are fine and you die in your spite!
We welcome anyone who comes. If it's just for external attacks, we're originally vulnerable to attacks from inside. They are officials who kill us vein after vein. Since things are so, terrorism which is right is welcome. Since we have no right, we have no right, the thing which is not right is welcome.
Take your time!
Is this middle-class housing hhhh, 600,000 dirhams or 700,000?
For me, my salary is 2,000 dirhams. Will I buy a house with this? This is not reasonable!
Congratulations Bouteflika! I am with you.
All congratulate Bouteflika!
I love Bouteflika. May God grant him long life and heal him, God willing!
Bouteflika has no power. He is forced. If he had little power, he wouldn't have accepted this farce. This is because he is an individual who has conscience even at some degree and even more logic. It's the mafia running the country. But God is the best of all planners!
It's a pity. This never happened in the world. But there is one thing, look at what Omar Ibn Khattab did and how he was ruling and you will know the meaning of politics. O monsters, God is sufficient for us and He is the best disposer of affairs! Where would you run away from God? May God take revenge on every liar! God willing, He will begin with your sons and offspring, this is in case you have offspring, o Lord! God awaits but doesn't neglect. God is sufficient for us and He is the best disposer of affairs.
My greetings to the colleagues, greetings of respect and acknowledgement!
A positive move!
Benkirane is the enemy of the Moroccan people.
May God grant success to everyone!
Honestly, I didn't like what you said, you're fooling us!
At last! This should have been done a long time ago, thanks to God!
He who interferes in what doesn't concern him will hear unpleasant things.
We want to work if you don't mind.
Jobs.
Everything is achieved through favouritism. It is only the rich who have opportunities. But the poor you make them poorer. God is sufficient for me and He is the best disposer of affairs!
Viva the Moroccan woman! If possible, I want to talk to you.
I would like to know necessary conditions.
So sorry for Tunisia, it has gone with the wind!
I support you.
The price of 7200 is too much!
In reality, for the first time in the history of Morocco we have a honest, effective and responsible government. I apologize I don't have Windows Arabic.
I think it's something good. As for those who say woman goes to the sea or is mistaken about Qur'an, it says teach your children swimming, not teach your children the bikini. God knows better!
I would like to know how can he say it is skin-tight? This is clear. Anything loose becomes tight. The most important is that we are covered, better than nakedness. Everyone will be held accountable before God depending on his intention.
They take care only of what they want, repair roads only they travel on. Wherever you go, roads are broken and bumpy. But they talk about renovating and reforming Club des Pins. We don't understand, we thought they were talking about us!
Our country is full of garbage and there are no roads, enough!
Yes, there is no one better than Sellal!
Viva Sellal!
Muslim is from the people. His rap is revolution not just playing.
Moslem is always the pride of rap singers and always with a new style!
They're talking about pay hike. What hike? It's a shame and disgrace to talk about wages in Morocco. O people, a police officer gets 3200 dirhams. How do you want him to live? What future does he have? No house, no allowances and marginalisation. If there is a riot or anything you find them the first to respond wherever you go in Morocco. It's a shame, for how long will Moroccans keep quiet?
They said you would have an increase of 5%.
Pay hike, hhh! Ok, they have done a pay hike, but why the hike in water, electricity and there are more hikes to come, hhh? May God help us!
This law cannot be implemented on the ground because the worker can be sacked.
What does the government say about people whose salaries vary between 3000 and 4000 dirhams when the minimum wage was 1300 dirhams? Now they will also be receiving the minimum wage! What has the government done for them???
Yes, you're right my brother, they are causing strife!
Pride to my brother Muslim! Wish you welfare all the life!
Who prevented you from saying names of those who made this country suffer and made the people jobless? .
You have entered with Islam to sell your CD's. If you want real rap, it's in America. You have ruined young people. Go, if you want to advise young people Muslim, show them how to make ablutions and perform prayer!
Very nice and the nicest thing is to see it implemented in the kingdom courts and cover everyone!
Thank you! By God, the way of God is continuing. God will support His servants! The flag of the state is high.
Viva Bouteflika and his prime minister Sellal!
I say that the best president after Bouteflika is Sellal.
O Lord support Bachar al-Assad!
We support those who reform the country. Viva the original FLN not Taiwan!
We hope this time words will be translated to actions as the situation is really unbearable.
If only it's true because the situation is really miserable.
I haven't understood anything! This is nonsense. This is a government not a social association. The role of this government is over and it's still saying we will do, we will consider, we will act, we will try. Between us, take care of young people or send them to build other peoples' countries if you don't recognize their competencies, we will offer loans, Benemester, Benkiran, Ben
God bless you! Thank you Slimani!
Number 444444444444, may God protect you for us, God willing!
ISIS is extremist and kills innocents.
I want to set up for the baccalaureate exam. However, I want to study vocational training to join the job market. I also suggest that many unemployed young people do some efforts to get job opportunities.
This solution is great! However, I too have a diploma in electro-mechanic but where are jobs in this Morocco?
The hike isn't enough.
What about officers in humanitarian associations? Are there any pay hikes? Or do they have no right to this?
They are fooling people!
Whether he is paid or not, this is the truth. There is a war between the groups and Bashar strikes everyone. If you want jihad, begin with yourself, reform yourself, contribute to the reform of your country. As for Syria and Palestine, they deserve our prayers because we don't have much resources and they have more resources than each other. They can't speak out because it's a political issue. Moreover, all this is part of the signs of the Hour. So, either you die for your children and your country or calm down. Jihad disbands families if it's not appropriate.
They killed us with lies! They are saying lies and lies. Lying ministers!
I swear by God he is saying the truth! O people use your reason a little. We're supposed to be Moroccans and cannot be deceived. Terrorist groups are seeking only their interests. Every group wants to rule and control. All those who fight with them are led like sheep to be slain. Go to lead jihad against Jews o men!
Good luck, may God protect and help you!
God is one and unique!
As Moroccan Muslims, we want Islam to spread in our country. We thank everyone who contributed to these Islamic banks.
If they loved Tunisia, they would have sought its welfare, but they want its ruin. They imagine it very wealthy and they are drawing money from its treasures. This money should rather be used to reform education, health, cleanliness of the country and projects which will boost economy. Isn't the public interest better than personal? In this way we will make the country move forward and not collapse altogether. Anyone who wishes the interest of the country shouldn't consider his interests only, he must be up to responsibility and leave a place for reconciliation.
When will this transaction be concluded? All Moroccans are waiting. Today, cumin grows then I irrigate you cumin! O Lord make a good outcome, say amen!
The Maghreb and Arab union in general.
We're fed up with you! Leave us in peace! We have enough concerns.
By God the greatest, they want to introduce dissent to the country!
I am the West. Thank you people of Algeria for refusing this! This is what we want, divide in order to conquer!
Mr Laryedh, you're done with the people.
Is this housing? This is nonsense. We are working at 80 or 100 dirhams a day, how can we buy 80 m at 7,200 dirhams. People are still living in slums. There are over 200 slums in Souk Sebt Jahjouh, province of the region of Lhajeb.
Greetings. Ali Benflis for the moment is better than Bojelika (rotten) of slogans!
The one whose time is over shouldn't take the time of others.
With Bouteflika to death, we know no one other than him!
Peace, mercy and blessings of God be upon you. The government shouldn't resort to expropriating lands of others. This is the first thing. Secondly, these buildings should be controlled. Thirdly, reduce the prices. Fourthly, allot a share to those who really need houses not make them available for all to speculate. This is totally unacceptable. May God help you!
May God protect sons of Algeria! May God protect them from the evil eye! May God protect us and protect the Umma of Mohamed!
Men, God willing, on the pitch! We support you whether you win or lose. 1, 2, 3 viva Algeria!
I hope the national side will win all games so that we would be happy. We haven't rejoiced for a long time. God willing!
May God support you!
Viva Algeria! Viva the national army! Viva national gendarmes! Viva national security!
Wake up, life is ephemeral!
Morocco is a country of drugs, Bilal, a country of drugs! Only corruptions comes to us from a country like this! We love you but you shouldn't poke your nose in this.
Correct your name first, Simo is Jewish. Now, everyone that comes wants to correct.
We are against terrorism. God is the greatest!
May God guide all Muslims! This killing in Syria and Libya, God has not ordered this. Jihad isn't in this way. One should protect his children and family, sacrifice for them so that they would be good sons and fear God. This is jihad not neglect their children and wives and go to kill people who are already in a civil war and it will be settled between them. Everyone should act for the interest of his family and country before becoming a terrorist and criminal!
Yes, true!
We fear only God the Almighty!
Is this true?
What's wrong with you or has life turned upside down for you and Arabs have become the biggest Jews? Jews don't kill each other. What stupidity! They are jealous from Morocco because they live comfortably. You see that Morocco lives comfortably, come and see with your eyes. Come and watch, you will be shocked. This is because people who die here in accidents are more than those who die in your country. May God guide His creatures! You missed Jews, you left them and you're coming to your brothers!
Give terrorism victims their rights then you can talk! My father is a patriot. They told him we won't pay you, the state hasn't insured you. Where are terrorism victims?
Daesh has emerged as a result of the pressure and unruliness of Arab rulers. They have filled it with debauchery, prostitution and theft. Daesh is the opposite of this. Even their image is being distorted, Daesh is better than all Arab rulers. Thanks to it!
Viva Algeria!
America has no relation with ISIS. America loves Moroccans and we know this. God the Almighty says: Allah does not support the wrongdoers. God says the truth.
Very nice!
Salam free Moroccans. I am a former soldier. If there is chaos in the country, I will answer the call, return to the army and defend the country because nationalism has no price. I am sure there are many people like me who are ready to defend the country.
Too much for us! Come on people, where are you? Our people is going to ruin!
We're still slaves of France, wake up!
They are scaring us.
This policy you are adopting to target the pockets of Moroccans is understood by the people to tackle inflation, hhhh! This is too much extortion. However, you are fooling the poor people. This government left nothing for Moroccans to say. Everything is studied. This is compounded even more by the housing minister. You are completing what was initiated by Hjira. Exalted be God! This beggars belief! 100 square meters at a fanciful price for an apartment hung in the air. This means the best investment you think of is investing in the pockets of Moroccans. May God guide you! You're playing with fire. This is my opinion.
Grant us tenured jobs so that we can buy this house! We have studied till we are worn out!
May God support the state and everyone who follows it everywhere!
Yes to the Islamic State to fight Rawafedh and Majous! We ask God to support and empower them!
God's curse on you ISIS! You think you're right, our prophet denies you.
God willing, God will guide our young people!
May God support them!
The best thing is to have Islamic banks.
Thank you!
Anyone who says the truth today is considered bad.
I would like to know necessary conditions.
I encourage the government in this project and wish all the good.
Thank God for this move!
Salam. We expect from the government to open companies where we can work. We don't expect of them channels. Where are funds we will invest in them? They are fooling us! Isn't this a shame? Poor young people are on the streets, no one will look at them, I am one of them...
Salam. Please, do they accept literature students as well?
True my brother Hamid with evidence from the Book and Sunna!
First of all, we have to follow the Islamic sharia to know if Abounaim was wrong or not. This is because our religion is in the Qur'an and we don't know it. This sheikh at least knows the Qur'an by heart and prays on time. Test both of them if Driss Lachgar learns the Qur'an by heart and prays on time, it is the sheikh who is wrong, but if it is the opposite... You should understand, I hope you understand!
Injustice you support it and help him do more injustice and prostitution. This Lachgar of yours has seen only Qur'an and polygamy as crime. We haven't even found one woman so that we can have more than 1 or 2. If he wants to help woman, he must help young people who can't find jobs or anything to do. You're just speaking out against polygamy! Have you left us anything for us as inheritance in this country so that we can have equal rights with women?! You don't like the truth and the support of God. You don't want to wake up about this strike of the sea which touched Casablanca and other cities. This is just a simple warning from God. You haven't seen anything yet. God is sufficient for me and He is the best disposer of affairs against you, o enemies of God! The support of God is coming soon God willing!
The sheikh is right. Muslims must speak out in Morocco and defend their Islam.
May God grant you success!
This is good for Moroccans as Muslims. May God protect our righteous people who wish the welfare of the country. O Lord upgrade this country, make it safe and support his majesty the king Mohamed VI!
O Lord make things easy, God willing!
May God grant you success!
May God bring all the good!
Are they fooling the citizens? With 7400 dirhams a square meter, they want to make a lot of profits! They are guessing the concerns of the citizens, so nice!
The price of 7200 dirhams a square meter is too much. If only they build such houses in Casa as we are homeless because of the high prices of high-standing houses.
May God guide you! They tell her, when you go out from water wet, it is skin-tight. She told them why magnify the issue. The life of the Muslim and the foreigner isn't the same. They want to wear hijab and live like foreigners. You should tell yourself woman that when you walk about in a two-piece on the beach, they don't watch you like when you wear this black suit. Of course, they look at you as if you came from the space. We don't understand whether you're deceiving God or deceiving yourselves. I ask God's forgiveness. You're fooling yourselves, you say I am covered, you're deceiving yourself! Enough! May God guide you Ratiba Marzouki!
Now Islam has become something shameful? May God guide you unveiled women!
By God, a good affair!
O criminals, animals, liars who sow dissent between Mujahids, these statements aren't true!
The country has given us nothing, barren, viva terrorism!
This is a man!
This is a great taste!
This is a very good taste!
A salutation to Mujahids!
To hell with terrorism!
I don't like enemies of Muslims and hate violence. Why is this happening? What can I say? Culture hasn't reached them yet! They are ignoramuses just like Libyans who killed their president without mercy. You should remember there is God, there is hell and there is paradise. It's God Who punishes not people.
May God help Tunisians! You shouldn't kill your brother in the name of religion o dog!
Spit on him! How filthy he smells! Tunisia is free with its men and its women not its Ben Laden!
God is stronger than you!
We are unemployed. We are waiting, may God help us! In Tunisia, nothing has changed. As usual, you study, graduate and stay home!
Hhhhhh, this reminds me of the day they said we will make Mascara like California! They harbour only evil. May God not help them!
You have shared out the country, all year you steal and lie to us. Remove the mask! We have uncovered you o traitors, shame on you!
Where is the money taken by Ben Ali, cars, palaces, euro, dollar, all currencies? By God, this looks like lies or where is the fact-finding committee? Or is it one of the games we're used to? Enough lies! The people are starved. However, this starving policy will turn against you with its its fury on your heads and the head of Merzouki and Gannouchi!
We're in Algeria, everything is possible! There are just words. Why during the war of liberation they didn't say those who are outside are scare? Now if they come and ask people of Algiers from where their fathers are. So we are people who normally love their country, all 48 provinces, my country. Never the Algerian would tell you I hail from an area.
Your rap is a revolution not just a play!
Reasonable words, this is true.
The messenger of God, peace be upon him, informed us about what is happening now.
Will Algeria give birth to men like Boumediene?
You have been sowing sedition all year long. May God inflict it on you! God willing, Algeria is still fine. Sedition, it is you who are stirring it. May God guide you!
By God, they're men and it's the country of men!
God bless you!
May God strengthen brotherhood!
May God increase herb so that the cow will produce milk!
God willing, terrorism will die and those who are with it, o Lord!
God willing, our country will be very fine, God willing, God will protect all security forces!
Religion has become foreign and will be again foreign as it has begun. A good state for foreigners!
hhhhhhhhhhhhh an imaginary article, it's not founded!
There is no power but from God! Lies and contradictions. Power is to God. Thank God, the Moroccan people have uncovered you.
This article is old.
No, no, thank you! We won't let it so that dissent would come to the country!
Yes 4, and with you president! May God heal you! We support you. You're the right man.
If only one bullet is shot, no one will remain, and add one more, no one will step in that place. They say Tunisians defy, hhhhh!
Yes to a 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 mandate! Then who? Because it is misery for Algeria! Who eliminated terrorism, who and who? Without talking, the country is fine so let it be fine. Don't ruin it! I will add to you something more. Bouteflika is our father. If Bouteflika goes, Algeria will return there. Who is going to mourn it? The wise understands.
May God protect us and grant us peace and all military in general!
Very good Algerian army, may God help you, God willing!
Amen o Lord!
May God protect Tunisia!
Now I don't know why they want to come to Morocco. What have we done to them?
We rely on God!
We killed ourselves in studies but got nothings. Some good students didn't pass and donkeys passed. This marking is defective. If only someone would find a solution with it.
The markers are unsuccessful.
May God damn the baccalaureate, the markers and the ministry! I have become exhausted and worn out about something called the baccalaureate! Spit on this life, spit on this state and spit! By God, if I find this baccalaureate! My group has graduates and I have spent my life preparing the baccalaureate. I am now 22. I am exhausted physically, intellectually and mentally.
Viva Algeria and down with everyone!
Not bad, it's even good!
I like these words.
Wake up! Oh, how did you find out this sir? They say Tunisians are no longer scared.
But all Moroccans aren't scared, as if there is nothing.
But Muslims as well have the right to go on pilgrimage in the holy city Jerusalem.
There is one solution, we should let everyone do the thing he considers to be the right thing.
Ok, we're here! Viva Algeria! We're its sons.
Take for me 50 m if you think that 5,000 dirhams is cheap!
These are lies, we have no Daesh.
It seems as if Nabil Benadballah isn't Moroccan! He talks about social housing and forgets the real cost which the people can't afford. Try to reduce prices so that they will be affordable for everyone. The poor are prejudiced.
Are you shame less? For me, even 1,000 dirhams is too much let alone 7,000 dirkams. This means we will have to start stealing!
This is good!
Well said!
Who are you sheikh to accuse anyone of disbelief? This disbelief will turn to you. So fear God sheikh you're on the way of misguidance!
By God bring them in, we are Muslims!
May God grant you all success, king, government and people!
This normal offer isn't fit for the middle-class. The price of 7200 dirhams for a square meter is very high compared to the income of this class. Therefore, if they can offer facilities in payments such as making a first installment of 10000 dirham then the remaining amount will be paid in installments of 1500 dirham a month while living in the house.
Everything will perish except God the greatest. Bounty and generosity are from God! As for those walls, may God make them collapse on you!
Honestly, we have waited for long for this project. I ask God to grant you success. However, there is one question, what about Nador? Here as well there are people who don't have a house and I am one of them. I hope Nador will have an opportunity in this project. By God, there are people here who endure the worst for a house.
Anyone who looks for leaders doesn't know the meaning of freedom.
May God drown Rabat robbers! The flat is worth 60,000 dirham and they sell it at 250,000 dirham, ouf! How much profit they make! Still you want them to care about the poor? They buy the land at 20 dirham a meter and sell at 7200 dirham. Cheap, this is nice! May God take revenge on them!
This Belmokhtar is wanted by America because he is a hero like Oussama Ben Laden, the lion of Islam and Saddam Hussein, may God rest his soul in peace! It wants to eliminate him.
Majority of people like the Islamic rule. So why do we still not live under an Islamic legal procedure to this day? We aren't demanding freedom or human rights. We the people want an Islamic rule only because our rights and obligations are in our religion.
Exalted be God! With all the marginalization in which we are, you still want to wipe your knife in it. Exalted be God! Now all the people have become aware of your deeds wholesale politicians! You're the ones who make people do such things.
Rif, Rif forever!
The most dangerous terrorist in Morocco that you must eliminate is the financial crisis. This is because poverty is the cause of this phenomenon in Morocco. It's poverty that leads to terrorism because it makes those you say to fund it have a financial control such as the corruption phenomenon. I have two questions: why do we have widespread corruption, bribery and terrorism? The answer is because we are human beings and anyone of us can face a financial crisis in which he can do nothing in this life. We ask God to adjust this country a little and grant young people jobs to work hard not arms to fight.
Dogs, they don't know the religion of Islam! They are in hell with Iblis! Go to liberate Palestine o mobs!
Nothing to do my brother this ISIS, you or anyone else are just harmful insects!
This is the one-eyed Antichrist.
This is not in the hand.
May God bring the welfare of this Umma!
The capital is the capital of all Algerians, ok. The problem of congestion is the problem of the organization of administration, ok. Are we bigger in number than Japan, China or France? O guys, it's a problem of organization.
Salam alikum. I hope you will post my comment. Moroccan young people are dying slow death. The government, God bless it, are fighting each other. Look at us and feel what we endure! Moroccan young people are psychologically sick. Find us some solution! They will bear our sin if we do something bad.
All Moroccans know that the group of Istiqlal party have been filling their pockets illegitimately ever since Morocco became independent to this day.
Guy, everything is a lie even in 2014, how have they waken up? They are still lying. may God protect us!
Dogs! Shame on you tyrants!
Salam. Unfortunately, Morocco has nothing to export. It is benefiting from customs and taxes on goods. What are we going to export to Europe? Tomatoes?
This is the historical plan of Israel: Euphrates, Nile, Great Israel, wake up Arabs!
May God protect our king Mohamed VI, o Lord! Whatever he does, we trust him.
O Lord protect Muslims from dissents!
Killing and chaos!
May God rest the souls of martyrs!
This is difficult in our country because there are excessive rises. It's the poor and middle classes which feel these rises. As for the rich class, they feel nothing. Therefore, it's difficult to limit these inequalities. There is a difference between the ones who gets a salary of 50000 dirhams and the ones who gets 1500 dirhams still he has to pay rental. The living is very difficult.
You believe someone like and what he says. You should rather look at the Book of God and the messenger of God peace be upon him. Everything small or big is there. Why should we listen to the statements of people even if there is a good,
You have been stirring strife all yours long. May God guide you! Algeria is still fine and you are gossiping. May God guide you!
Congratulations to him! Sellal is a well-known son of the country.
Give us a good solution! We've had enough with rhetoric!
In the name of freedom, we have remained a shame o Arabs!
I support Sellal, he is a good man.
This is not reasonable. We want Morocco. Try to kill terrorism!
Yes, I know they can do nothing. With the help of God, all together, we will certainly protect Tunisia.
May God rest their souls in peace!
May God rest their souls in peace, God willing!
May God rest the souls of the nation martyrs!
May God rest his soul in peace our dear one!
It is necessary to eliminate corruption.
May God rest their souls in peace!
Because their shelf-life has expired from the point of view of the ruling system. This is confirmed by the fact that the same faces are turning around in the market of politics!
O killer, go wherever you go?
Enough lies! Now that the attack of terrorism came, where was the security forces you were talking about? It attacked soldiers, and the rest are just words.
KAMEL ZAROUK is our cheikh and I love him for God's sake.
I am against all these jihadists. May God guide them or take them!
God and His prophet, Peace be Upon Him, ordered jihad. So why are you against God and His prophet, Peace be Upon Him?
A nation died for you and you're still talking! Shame on you! But there is one thing, God exists!
Viva freedom! Leave us in peace o state!
You have paid this guy to say these statements.
Nekkaz found a way with this regime, lool!
O president you still have energy
Rule is for the people who don't seek it.
We put the blame on Jews and Christians for falsification, what about Muslims and the Qur'an?
With Bouteflika till death! We don't know anyone other than him.
In reality, we need the Islamic investment to strengthen economy with all fields. Job opportunities should be offered to all competencies and all sectors in construction or investment. We are waiting for you.
It is ISIS which will be victorious. It will form an Islamic Emirate, God willing!
The organization terrorizes Muslim countries
This year the cup is for us.
It means that you Mr Abdo will show us the meaning of jihad? Exalted be God! Go man and find somewhere to die!
Salam. As a Moroccan citizen who loves the homeland, I call on Moroccan intelligence and American intelligence to control arms' deals of ISIS. Viva the king and homeland!
Morocco is ready to fight terrorists.
Where there be a war?
I hail from Morocco. I recognise only one religion, it's Islam. It's the religion of morals, tolerance and brotherhood. Islam isn't a religion of violence, terrorism or blood. It has spread the message humanely. This is how Islam has been spread, o Arabs, in the era of the prophet, peace be upon him, with respect to other non Muslim religion. They are considered without religion or faith, which means honestly hhh pagans.
Islam isn't associated with terrorism, war and blood. It's the religion of tolerance and morals. As for other non-Muslim religion, I consider them pagans, hhh, because they have no religion except killing and destruction. Their fate before God is hell. As regard ISIS, I don't recognize your religion, it's fake.
By God, it's not the mistake of pupils! It's markers. Now, they forgive them, the dogs who were tough with us in marking. We ask them to be lenient with us next year in marking.
Truly the markers are unsuccessful.
Who talked about it, who said it's even nice!?
You're right. The army is strong and the people is strong.
O Lord support the right wherever it is!
I am her close friend. All these are lies. Everything you say is wrong.
For your honour, you will do more than this!
By God, if you can get in touch with them, send them to Tunisia! God bless you!
I hope no one think badly of her.
Thanks to the country of 1500000 martyrs!
7,200 dirhams is the current price for social housing in the country. There are even lower prices in some places. This state is supposed to reduce the price from those in the market because they aren't going to pay the price of the land.
If the square meter is 7,200 dirhams and the smallest apartment is 80 square meters, this means the smallest thing costs 576,000.00 dirhams. How much do these poor people of the middle-class earn to get a loan like this? The people can't even buy an apartment worth 200,000. dirhams let alone a flat at this above-mentioned price! They are making a new project to enrich people and not to offer housing to people. God is sufficient for me and He is the best disposer of affairs!
For me, the middle-class in this country represents the employee who earns more than 5,000 dirhams a month. As regard the poor class, they get 1,500 dirhams a month, it can't even secure his living let alone thinking of interests. This is a shame on you rich class!
Let them fool us, they are privileged!
Our country is the strongest Arab country. However, soldiers should be helped by proving everything for them.
O Lord make things easy for us!
This is required.
O Lord support ISIS!
I was mistaken about brother Fizazi? He's right. The problem is with us. There should be solutions at all levels and peace. Going to Syria isn't the solution. We must find solutions for young people to find jobs. The school should do its duty towards our sons.
This one spoke the truth and they wanted to investigate with him! This is injustice! Moreover, the accusations of apostasy he addressed to those people are true. Do they need to tell lies and challenge God's religion? Those people don't know anything about religion.
Nowadays, anyone who says the truth is assaulted.
We want Islamic banks. We hope from God to facilitate things for everyone who contributed to introducing Islamic banks. The Moroccan citizen needs so much Islamic banks.
Thanks to Justice, we support Benkirane!
Now that the big signs of the Hour are close by, now you have seen this, where have you been all this time?
We want to work if you don't mind.
Jobs weren't found even by those who deserve them!
We want to work if you don't mind.
This project is excellent. However, the price is high.
God is sufficient for us and He is the best disposer of affairs. Is the Moroccan government not Moroccan? This is calumny. Is the territory of Morocco you are cutting as you want with total transparency not for all Moroccans?
Tranquillity between us!
You have made me happy this day, may God make you happy this morning! The dream of my life is to own a house but I can't for 38 years now. Now, I have a feeling if this project is realized, I will achieve my wish, God willing, thanks to you sir!
I think they were wrong in naming the class. I think they mean the rich class in Morocco.
This issue requires conscience more than it requires law. We need to implement holy Qur'an literally and follow the Sunna of our prophet, peace be upon him, if we want rescue in this life and the afterlife. Enough dependency! Use your mind and implement even a verse from the Qur'an or word from the Sunna and you will find the solution!
Poverty is the cause.
This is a gain for all Moroccans not just the government. So thanks to everyone who contributed to this project with his ideas or action. O Lord make things easy for everyone!
May God bring all the good!
Praise be to God! The Justice and Development Party is doing the most of its efforts. May God help them and thwart their enemies and our enemies who were ruling before them! They are purposely disturbing them because now as you know they have stopped everything for them and they can't accept that.
We need Islamic banks.
Will these Islamic banks not impose interests on Moroccan citizens?
We hope so! We rely on God and the government in introducing Islamic banks.
We wish success for Benkirane and steadfastness for this country which has gone through all forms of injustice, and oppression and where the strong eat the weak. We hope the day will come when we will see every Moroccan acting for his country with jealousy for his country. The Moroccan people have had enough and its people are immigrating outside the country.
Go and speak out only about your Moroccan brothers only like those little boys who were raped by Daniel or the woman who gave birth on the streets close to the hospital, I spit on you mean people!
My friend, by God, what do you understand of politics, Americans and drugs? You said nothing, not even one good sentence. Go and find who Mohamed 6 is and find what he wants to do for this country, then you can talk sir! We shouldn't just say nonsense. Salam.
Nothing important as usual. Morocco will never move forward. Even if we want it to progress, they don't want. They want to make illegitimate money, that's all.
Finally he woke up from his sleep! He just felt that the people are dying while they don't care about them. But what are they going to say to God? He is the one Who will reward us. As for the government and the king, may God forgive them for what they are doing to these people. This is because we love peace, this is our reward. All this because it's the rich who are living while the poor are feeling the burden. The last word I will say is viva king Mohamed VI! As for the government, it should be held accountable for all these 5 years it has spent.
Our king is one Mohamed VI and others are thieves.
He didn't take out the money from his pockets so that you can say he did this and this. But say he took this and this!
Popular Islamic State.
You want to push Algeria into a civil war, then you will be responsible for this.
Viva the condition and wine!
ISIS has become (expletive)
Salam. My brother, by God, if you grant us jobs, you will receive a big reward, you will rescue a lot of young people including me so that they wouldn't go to steal or commit some terrible crime. I apologize for these words. Thank you
We just want to work, may God reward you with good! We are tired.
They offer jobs only to people who have money.
I am Naim Oughnni. I am looking for a job. I have experience as seamstress and in working in a hotel. But there is nothing. Now I need a job as I provide for my family. Please help me!
Hi! By God, it's good to work with you!
Guy, I read a little at the beginning and in the end. But nothing! Just many unnecessary promises. There is nothing good to be done in Morocco, it's suitable for the bourgeoisie.
I want to work. Help me please! I am the one who provides for my family.
May God protect you Bouteflika and grant you good health, God willing!
I am proud of a president like Bouteflika. May God heal him and protect him for us God willing!
May God rest the souls of those who died!
There are doubts about it, there is a mouse somewhere.
May God rest the souls of our dead people and may God inspire their families with forbearance!
May God rest the souls of these martyrs in peace, God willing!
May God rest the souls of those who died in aircraft!
God willing, he will run for the elections! I support him 100%.
We ask God to support us against those who are hostile to us. May God protect us and protect our dear country!
I support Sellal as president.
These people like to eat and sleep!
Wake up for yourself dear son! It is swept by the ravine and they say the year is nice! Even God the greatest denies you!
May God support our Mujahid brothers wherever they are!
They took more than necessary. They should have helped vulnerable classes. People are still living in slums and they are looking for compensation and say the Tunisian to the Tunisian is mercy. They are bad even to each other.
May God heal you!
This year he will be 33 not 23.
Hhhh, your case is difficult in maths! 1981 means he is 33 not 23. Make your calculation then you can talk!
Enough of old figures, give the opportunity to young Algerians! Your gardens are ripe, you are never saturated! If it were me, I would have invested everything in Algeria. But you steal and don't enjoy that money. May God guide you! God is sufficient for us and He is the best disposer of affairs!
Go steal if you can, why (unclear) enough! You think you are in the aircraft of ageing, hhhhh, it is clear you are senile!
Just make a calculation my brother! He was born in 1981, it means he is 33. Now take off years. This means 25. Now recalculate, you're mistaken.
Peace and mercy of God be upon you. "if you support Allah, He will support you."
Everyone is speaking his language. Some accuse of kufr and some send you to hell. No one knows what happens. But the truth is in front of our eyes and we don't want to see it. Most Arab countries have been destroyed. The only enemy is Israel.
Ok, Islam and they have rights and work for young people. Morocco is the best country I saw.
There is no power but from God! No comment!
Viva our Bouti, our dear president! May God protect him, God willing! He is my only hope in this life.
We need men to rule the country. We don't want cloaks to deplete the resources of the people. Spare our people! We are the small people we don't need anything, only work and security.
Yes, a fourth mandate and if God helps him, a fifth, God willing!
We want news about the Moroccan economy.
We hope to have a club prepared for young people.
They have oppressed us. If only they see how retired people live, they would feel ashamed!
I support Bouteflika and viva Algeria!
I am Hamouda from Oran. We haven't seen anything from this country. I am fed up with myself. I am fed up with (unclear). We will still see.
I support you with my heart and Lord.
Yes, you're right.
Why my dear sister? We commit sins and God the Almighty forgives us. As for this, it is an instigation between two people. We are brothers, you are free to express your opinion.
You're worth the world my brother!
Well-done Kafon! By God you have uncovered their papers!
Good and he is a man!
Yes, well-said!
I haven't seen anything. Now you want to make of drugs one of your rights. But religiously, it is forbidden. Legally, it is banned. Morally, it's not acceptable. Therefore, please my son, just hold on to your rap and defend something useful!
We, all the people, are with you!
Night has fallen the smile, the tear is dropping, poor!
I love you Bilal, for so long you're in my blood!
These terrorists go and kill people there and you say may God rest his soul in peace? These people when they will come back to Morocco, they will do the same things here and you will see. Are you normal?
We don't want to prepare for the Cup because of this serious disease.
I like Cheb Bilal!
As Moroccan, the favourite artist and singer is Bilal. Bilal forever!
There is no other God but Allah!
This Ansar we love them!
They must highly tighten restrictions on prison!
Viva Morocco to death!
I support security. Welcome ISIS! By God you will buried alive!
Sleep father, cover yourself well from the cold! As for the rest, it's very far away from you! They say they are offending us!
Terrorism is made by the West.
This al-Baghdadi is Shiite. How could he appoint himself Caliphate. He believes he is a leader. If he were a real man, let him come to Morocco along with the hypocrites who follow him!
If anyone wants to come, let them come. We're not scared of anyone. May God protect our king! For his wife, that's her business. As for you, mind your own business! In addition, in the end it's God Who holds us accountable for our deeds not people like you! Lala Salma has done only good deeds to you.
These are just dogs of terrorism. They have marred Islam. Morocco is up to confront dogs like them. Spit on terrorism, homeless!
If they want to look for it, they're welcome. No fear from those who are found alone. Nothing scares us. If someone wants to be beaten, he is welcome. Away, you're registered!
He should be punished. This is not fair.
Burning her is not legal.
By God, I don't know from where they came up with this story. I live in Ibn Khouldoun neighbourhood and no one heard about this story. By God, it is really odd!
May God rest her soul in peace! This is the will of God, pray for her mercy and may God forgive her father for what he did to his daughter.
My problem is that my husband is very vicious in the way he speaks. I am tired of such words and problems without reason. I don't know why I am afflicted with problems. I don't know what to do with him. Please advise me!
He should be punished and we should pray for her mercy. However, we should see his feeling because he is a human being. Islam advised us to educate our children with mercy. That's all. I hope everyone will know the merit of children and parents. Salam alikum.
This is not a father. He is certainly an animal. May God ruin him! Shame on him! Death is too little for him! Relics of a corrupt society!
God is sufficient for us and He is the best disposer of affairs! Enough burdening the citizen with high prices, 7,200 dirhams. O God this is enormous!
What a bargain! This is a real bargain! Finally, you thought of us; I am happy, the price is very adequate! So nice, I will realize my dream. 7,200 dirhams, show me where this project is located, I will participate as of tomorrow!! Go, may God curse you o bunch of thieves and bloodsuckers! From God we are and to God we shall return! God is sufficient for me and He is the best disposer of affairs!
Viva our country, its people and president Bouteflika! May God heal him!
To tell you the truth, we are aware of what you're doing. Your day will come for fooling the people!
God is sufficient for me and He is the best disposer of affairs!
What was said by Lachgar was just an electoral campaign. He couldn't face people in the government so he used another way: religion. Religion is that of God the greatest. It is not the religion of Abounaim. I think that woman took all her rights and so she just has to work and benefit society. The issue of heritage cannot be discussed or be subject to any derogation. We are a Muslim society, our constitution says so. So why does this Lachgar want to change the constitution? Say it directly without hiding behind constitution!
"When the ignorant address them, they say peace." Driss Lachgar has nothing more to say, politics are over and he found only the religion of God! "Whoever transgresses the limits of Allah has certainly wronged himself." Anyway, Lachgar has the government, before that he has Moroccan local affairs. Religion is beyond his reach and beyond the reach of many!
You still don't want to leave that man in peace? Prosecute and investigate with that apostate Assid who insulted the prophet, peace and blessings of God be upon him. Enough hypocrisy our scholars! You're known, enough treason of religion and the homeland. Go corrupt somewhere else! May God turn their plots against them and rescue sheikh Abounaim of your madness, amen, amen, amen!
May God protect our country from all evil! Look at what is going on in all Arab countries!
Viva sheikh Abounaim! Thank you!
7,200 dirhams is too high!
May God bring a solution! They think that they made an achievement with 7,200 dirhams a meter! It is too much!
We hope this will be as soon as possible.
You don't see the rich class which vies with everyone, with the middle-class and the poor class. Look at what happens to people in Ahl Laghlam and Alhrawin, rich people take advantage of the poor even in their daily living. May God have mercy on the people!
I thought hard about it and found it is too much!
I like Aziz.
All social categories should be taken into consideration. In my opinion, the reasonable and affordable price for all is 5,500 dirhams.
By God, and in an area 22000 km away from the city. This is madness, urbanization and residents won't reach there only when our great-grandsons come!
Firstly, what is the middle-class in this country?
You know, this ISIS in Morocco, they are in the market selling sardines! God, the homeland, the king and Dortmund hhhh!
The north is always resisting to colonization. The best resistance in Morocco is in the north. It's even the best in the world at the time.
Salam alikum. May God accept your fasting. ISIS has nothing to do with Islam! Keep away from the ignorant. You're people wreaking havoc on earth and they don't know. We are hard for you ISIS. If you dig, you will find, hhh!
Yahya Cama. May God support the Islamic State against Jews and the tyrants!
What are the advantages of an Islamic bank?
Algeria Christian, God willing!
Killing is haram in our religion Islam. This is a shame and disgrace for Muslims.
God willing, you will find it! God willing, there will be all the good, God willing!
May God rest their souls in peace!
God willing, Bouteflika will take it!
You are terrorists, you and you're the biggest head o poor people!
God's curses on you! You've brought us back to the second ignorance era! May God take revenge on you!
First thing, you should learn how to arrange the map of Morocco, then you can talk about domestic policy, ok! The site is 0!
You have ruined the people a long time ago and you still want to mess it up! We're fed up! Leave us in peace! We're living well and want tranquillity. If you have lost dear ones during the black decade, you would have known how to act. You were all applauding Bouteflika, and now you turned against him o dogs! You're all traitors! Viva Bouteflika even if he gave me nothing! Salam.
May God curse them and don't grant them any power! May God uncover them wherever they go and uncover them as they have humiliated Islam and Muslims!
Are there any jobs? We want to work in that job.
We want to work. We have become addicted to drugs and hallucination pills because of the government and unemployment. Stop lies, by God, you have exhausted us!
They are lying to us. There are no jobs in this country.
Wake up, they are placating us with such headlines. By God, if your father isn't influential, you won't work in this country. They offer jobs to their sons and families. As for us, sons of the people, we are subject to price rises and repressions. However, this won't last for long because God does not accept injustice. This means they are unjust to us but God is the greatest!
This is good because there is a lot of unemployment. May God bring all the good!
This is good.
I am looking for a job.
I have 4 years' experience in the firm Papelera De Tetouan. Now I am jobless. I am looking for a job.
I want to buy my house. May God help us!
All these stories are narrated in a new version. I was an employee within professional integration. We were fired. I filed a complaint to the ministry. I wrote to the prime minister. But there was no consideration. So you know young people only in elections. May God guide you! Listen to me and look at what goes on!
The solution is one, Bouteflika. There is no president. They're all thieves.
The bee-keeper has built a house but the teacher hasn't yet!
Hhhhh, they're fooling the people!
Salam. This is a country we must preserve. Thank you!
Algeria is (expletive), they gave us nothing, state of (expletive). This Bouteflika, he is about to die and he is going to rule us. This is nice! even strangers are better than you.
Yes, true, we must put hand in hand because one hand can't clap alone.
Who paid the ransom to Somalian hijackers?
This is what we wished, God willing, wish you success!
Thanks, valuable information!
Women must cover themselves firstly so that they won't be victim of harassment because their dresses have become very provocative for men.
Jihad is in Palestine.
Whatever they do, Arabs agree not to agree! May God bring all the good!
There is no terrorism but our government!
His majesty the king, may God protect him for us, may God help him, wishes the welfare of the country but people need to help each other. May God help them!
Thank you, thank you, ahead God willing!
It is right, more!
These words are nice but in practice, things are different, hhh!
May God help them, God willing!
God bless you! This is very positive for the two sisterly people!
2,333.76 pffff! They get billions and fool us!
He was connected when he was there.
there is big contradiction in your words! You came, you were arrested, but how did you get in touch with people?!!!
Go my son and live in peace and tranquillity! These Syrian people found no one but you to support them! They found you fools and keep on fooling you! Who will be responsible for the suffering of mothers? 1, 2, 3 Jihad, look at yourself first, do your duties towards your family and your country then look for other areas o knight of losers! People like you only deserve prison. They need, let me silent, that's all. They say, 1, 2, 3, support the Syrian people! So odd, sir, the product of the pressure cooker!
The only jihad is in Palestine.
Terrorism of dictator Arab regimes is the worst terrorism at all!
I think that this individual who has gone there, has gone to terrorists not the free army. May God support the free army!
I wish victory to Abdelaziz Bouteflika, God willing!
You are paid or instigated, that's clear, not by the people, Bouteflika couldn't eat and make 38 millions eat, hhhh!
Bouteflika has come to stir a civil war in Algeria.
I support Bouteflika in whatever he says.
Amend the constitution as you want, enough rights for women, they're too much for them!! They have expelled us from our houses. You can no longer talk to your sister or wife. You have made them our bosses, God is our mandate against you!
My brother, what are you taking about? They silence you with 2 kilogrammes of potatoes while they are swallowing 100000000 of dollars. If he were as you say better, corruption and killing wouldn't have spread in these recent years. The country will be in chaos. Just wait and see, he will run for the fourth, he will reach the people, he will die there. Then you will see well what goes on.
May God help you! God willing you will always make new work and always bring us joy! I would like to send greetings to the sons of my neighbourhood who are inside or outside prison, sons of the neighbourhood of BOURMANA SFAX ROUTE CHAKER KLM 2.
The words he says are true. I am one of the people who offer this song to all my friends without forgetting the lovers of CHIKHA WELAD LA HEWAM.
Exalted be God, to anyone who says Algeria is mine, it belongs to God!
balam balam prisons are opening their mouths and eating everyone Ham Ham!
Victory is coming, coming, don't worry!
Good, Cheb Bilal!
God is above everyone!
Victory for Islam!
There is no power and no will but from God!
Everything said by Cheb Bilal is true and we all want money. Bilal forever to death!
We have nothing to do with football as we are still in this sensitive period of Ebola disease.
May God help us so that they would accept hosting it!
May God heal him, God willing, we support him!
Congratulations to us! He deserves more than this, may God heal him, God willing! We support him.
God willing, they will make you pay everyone of you!
Criminal!
The most hideous thing in Tunisia is this, hhh!
The concerns of the countries in the region aren't limited to Algeria and Tunisia. Neighbouring countries must all interact. This means where are the decisions of the Arab Maghreb states? However, the French colonizer has left its primitive relics featured by the stubbornness of ruling regimes. As for us - the people - we have no power with you. The military junta in Algeria and the Moroccan policy on the other hand. Therefore, wake up rulers! Otherwise your turn will come and you will regret it. The colonizer always thinks of its interests, always!
Activating the Arab Maghreb only!
Power, killer, they're the same. You're like them.
God, the Homeland, Mohamed peace be upon him.
7,200 dirhams a meter makes 80 meters at 576,000 dirhams. This is madness!
May God help you my sister!
Mercy in our societies! The girl is burnt and the boy has the right to everything. What's the hope? There is no power but from God!
There is no power but from God!
It is supposed to be the role of the mother to control her daughter and guide her not the father. The mother is a school. She is the role model for her children.
Hhhh, you're fooling the people, but only God is most powerful! I am not a big writer. I want something based on real foundations not laziness. Ok, if I wanted to enhance my position, not in the hands of Makhzen or anything you know. I want something really founded. You understand what I mean. Without humiliation, even if I write plainly, not because we find a problem in Morocco. If you want to make sure, go to Bir Jdid and see how people live. There is nothing, everyone is harmed there.
Rich people will buy them to sell them at a higher price even if it is originally a high price!
This is madness! They sell the monkey and laugh at its buyer!
This ISIS group is treacherous and lying. It kills innocents. It's terrorist 100%.
Give us independence of Sahara! We don't want anything from you.
We have to revive the Sunna of the prophet, return to the Book of God and implement the sharia of God. This is Islam.
Salam alikum. Now for how long since the first revelation of the Book of God, infidels are doing all they can to distance us from our religion. In other words, it is "a war on Islam". Now they are doing all they can to defame people who advocate the truth. But thank God, they aren't fighting us. They are fighting the greatest Creator, Allah. God is the greatest! We will all dies, we will all meet him with our deeds. May God take revenge on those who distanced us from the words of God, our religion!
There is nothing, this is just acting! As for the working class, it is always in the bottom! May God bring some solution! As for the government, everyone is acting for his interests.
They are mistaken, they wanted to say 7200 cents, hhh!
ISIS is an American policy.
May God protect this country, king Mohamed VI, may God support him and the Moroccan people!
Are you mad or what?
Who benefits from the acts of ISIS?
This is true. But who does this? If we know them, we can find a solution for these young people who go on a way that will destroy their lives and leave them disoriented.
Terrorism is America not ISIS.
This is too much! This is impossible! This is expensive. The middle-class shouldn't exceed 140.000.00 dirhams, ok, this should be the price!
You deserve it!
God is sufficient for us and He is the best disposer of affairs! May God take revenge for every oppressed person in all Muslim countries God willing!
God willing, Bouteflika will take it!
Bouteflika deserves it. However, he is sick. Even if he wins, he is the president of Algerians truly. One things should be explained, they are sharing the resources of the country and the mean sow the wind. At least adopt a position of men!
Intentional rumours, he wants to spotlight his name.
If you want Tunisia to recover and be peaceful, vote for Slim Riahi because for other candidates, they are just seeking interests. As for Slim Riahi, he is already very rich.
May God support you leader, you're a good leader! May God support you against your enemies and make Morocco safe and secure of dissents! We, your people, support you!
May God support our king! This donkey of Joe are considering just the king! It is clear Moroccans are putting a crusher in your eyes.
May God bring all the good!
May God protect Tunisia!
May God bring all the good!
Slim Riyahi is the right captain to lead Tunisia to the safe coast.
He is welcome, may God grant him success!
God bless you and your parents!
Peace and mercy of God be upon you. I am a young man from the capital. I am 19. As far as I know, God willing, God will bring someone who will spread the religion of Islam perfectly, this doctor we are following won't take us on a long way. God willing, young people ask God, God willing to show the truth from the falsehood!
I support in opinion Ali Belhadj.
This is the way of Morocco for a long time. Don't be surprised my brothers, change comes with blood. It is necessary and you will get it by force so that rights will be restored to their owners. Victory or martyrdom!
Is there any job with you?
The one who says to people send your CVs, if he has tried hardships of going and submit your CV, people who have no mercy. You will find that someone helped him get a job.
I want a job.
I have been looking for a job for some time in anything, but in vain. I am tired of job-hunting and submitting CV. Everything is through favouritism.
We are tired of unemployment, find some solution for us!
There are no jobs or anything. If you have a relative in this Morocco, he will give you a job. You can work through favouritism and money, that's what we have.
From God we are and to God we shall return!
I love Bouteflika of Algiers. I hail from Annaba.
May God rest their souls in peace!
It's not you who will say this is Muslim and this is not. All the people know the truth of ISIS. Its acts weren't done by the prophet, a thousand peace be upon him. We're not honoured to receive them in Tunisia. They have killed souls, dishonours women and sells them. This shouldn't be done if they had a religion or principle. They don't recognize the existence of God in their acts this ISIS.
Sellal or Allal, it is the same!
They are saying nonsense, enough! Is all this happening in Algeria!
There is no government in our country.
By God cheikh, God's curse on you!
May God support the truth and protect our security services, without them, we wouldn't be able to do anything!
Viva the national army!
Dialogue with all sides is the solution.
But I would like to know how and who is the mastermind of these terrorist acts!
May God guide them! They can do nothing to Algeria.
I am Issam. I work in the police.
If there is any terrorism, it is the ministry of the interior!
Viva Algeria, 1, 2, 3! A salutation to people of Adrar, country of religion and education!
I would like to know who funds terrorism and how they entered Tunisia.
O Lord send a relief to the Libyan people, reform the country, restore security and be as it was and better, o Lord! I am a Tunisian woman, however, my heart is highly pained for it as if it were my own country. God willing, they will be fine! May God rest the souls of the dead and introduce them to paradise as they are martyrs in their country, grant patience to their mothers. We live in security and people, but this is unfortunate, we are suffering for them. May God protect dear Libya because it's part of me along with Tunisia. God willing they will expel Ansar al-Sharia from it!
Jihad is in Palestine. God the Almighty says even if the ruler is unjust, we shouldn't disobey him. If you strike the ruler of country, you want sedition in the country as it happens for our brothers in Egypt and Tunisia. May God guide us and relieve Palestine! Say amen!
God is sufficient for me and He is the best disposer of affairs!
I love Algeria.
Ali Belhadj a president???? By God, I can't find the words to say anything. God is sufficient for me and He is the best disposer of affairs!
Tunisia is the country of apostates. I don't respect those who insult religion and the messenger of God, Peace be Upon Him. I had respect for Merzouki, but unfortunately, the people and government are coward.
This is one of the dogs of Zionism and freedom of expression! Takfir has its limits. I am against terrorism and intimidation but with expelling from Tunisia.
When you say the prophet, say "Peace be Upon Him", this is the least thing you can do. But he makes drawings of the prophet, Peace be Upon Him, and you want them to kiss him! Freedom stops when there is question of God and His prophet, Peace be Upon Him. I wished he would receive the capital punishment not two years in prison. This is absurd!
Pfff, this is what we're good at, whatever they do, you're not happy. The government hasn't yet established its place and you are judging it, and we're not happy, pff!
There are words but there is no action!
Viva the army and security!
Viva Tunisia!
May God help you!
God bless the security and army!
Viva Tunisia! God willing it will be victorious thanks to its men, o Lord! Viva security officers!
May God support the Arab army, o Lord!
We must strengthen the national spirit of Tunisians.
God willing, what is coming is better!
Let's join the ministry of the interior as civil workers with guards and police. Let us help them on neighbourhoods and streets. We know every small detail. Viva Tunisia with its people!
We want to be integrated in the civil service of the ministry of the interior.
God is sufficient for me and He is the best disposer of affairs! Why wasn't Lachgar put on trial? Reply to me o people who have living minds!
Here is oil has dropped guy!
There is no one like Bouteflika! There is no one you can trust. The country doesn't need chaos. We are fine with him, if he isn't fit, we won't be angry.
May God help you Kafon!
It isn't good what you did to Kafon who was with you till morning.
What happens in Syria is illegal.
Well-done! God willing always like this! Seher Bn Trad.
May God help all rap singers and all Tunisian young people! Spare us backwardness! They say a year of drugs. From where did you come up with this? And a add a million, hhh!
Kafon is in prison for a drug case not freedom of expression!
You remember young people only during elections for your interests. What would you want to do for these young people if they vote? What play are you repeating during every elections? Find some new scenario which is well-plotted. This is no longer useful for you except for the old ones you still can influence to sum up.
Pride to Muslim men, there are none left, the state oppresses them!
You're right!
My brother is with me, even recently, by God, let him go!
For how long are you going to keep in this way? You are lying to yourselves, dividing yourselves into Shia, Sunna and Salafia while our religion is one and our God is one? So why do you divide your religion? Do you want to extinguish the light of Allah, but Allah will perfect His light, although the disbelievers dislike it, even if the criminals disliked it. I don't want to know your intention. God says something, but you and your parents say something else. So why don't you follow what was revealed by God or do you want the judgement of the time of ignorance? Or do you fear Jews and Christians?
I hope you will reconsider yourselves, you and your parents before God sends you His torture! Torture is surrounding you and you're not aware of it.
The health of citizens is more important than the CAN.
The most important thing is that countries where Ebola is spread should come here without fans as we have fans.
Until you die, hhh!
Nonsense, that's all!
From where did this kindness to citizens come? There are poor people in hospitals, waiting in long queues, they oppress them with appointments today the disease (unclear)
I want to go to the army.
In Morocco, the police are everywhere. There is no place for ISIS or anything else.
If this ISIS comes, they will know who we are! God, the homeland and king. May God support our king! These Dogs are Khawarej! Blessed are those who kill them and the one who is killed by them.
"If there comes to you a disobedient one with information, investigate, lest you harm a people out of ignorance and become, over what you have done, regretful." I am not with or against because I haven't listened to the statements of the two sides. When America killed our brothers in Iraq, no one said America was terrorist. Now Israel is killing our brothers in Palestine no one says it's terrorist. If they are Muslims, they would go to Palestine for jihad. If they don't go, they are under the power of Israel. Their aim is to distract Muslims from Palestine. God knows better!
Peace, mercy and blessings of God be upon you. We will say what was said by the messenger of God Mohamed said, I left for you the holy Qur'an and my Sunna. If you follow them, you will never go astray or be in hardship after me. The prophet of God speaks the truth. May God guide us to the right way! This religion is mercy.
May God help you!
Good!
May God forgive former governments and even the current one because how will the poor people save 57 millions while their salary is 2,500 dirhams?
By God, they are fooling us! I don't know if they have calculated it or if they are just talking. God is sufficient for me and He is the best disposer of affairs!
O Lord this is enormous! May God take revenge on these officials, they have oppressed us!
Even 200 dirhams is too high!
This is real foolishness, these 7,400 dirhams! Offer some apartments at 100,000 dirhams then say you did something for the middle-class, o sons of...
For example, my salary is 2,500 dirhams, and want to buy a house with an area of 60m, so I need 430,000 dirhams. Do I have to rob or kill?
You think you are the middle-class?
Didn't cross Libya, o people!
I am free!
By God, I say sedition is worse than killing! As for others, they might say whatever they want. There are sides specializing in fatwas and they are protected by the commander of the believers king Mohamed VI, may God protect him from all evil and protect our country from strife!
Moroccans are all justice whether they like it or not!
May God rest the souls of all those who died!
We Moroccans aren't afraid of terrorism or anything. We fear only God the greatest. We will defend our country to death. God, the homeland and king.
Yes, the state of Morocco needs Al Qaeda to eradicate all forms of immorality in Marrakesh, Agadir, Essaouira and all tourist cities.
God is the greatest!
God willing we will be able to uproot this ISIS and more because we die for our country, children, king and God.
I want to become a soldier.
Nonsense, meaningless words.
My father is 60. Will he go on retirement or what?
Ok, it is good if optional.
What about those who left school at the fourth year? Should they die?
I hope it will eliminate unemployment and reduce the suffering of students.
You have recruited people who have the baccalaureate + 2 years and people who have studied up to the baccalaureate level. You need to add people between them. Their numbers are increasing in retirement as well. May God bring all the good! Prepare the platform of employment then find new options!
The best thing is reconciliation between Algerians in spite of our enemies! My brothers, all the Algerians, in spite of...
It is just you who is no one like you!
Hhh, Sellal is fooling you so that you vote for Mr Bouteflika!
Thank God! Our country is the best country! It just needs some organization and control.
If they don't find solutions for loans, there will be a catastrophe. We should find a solution without lying to ourselves. The middle-class is drowning and threatened.
Speak only in Arabic please! This is not criticism, but an advice. The solution.
The solution is to increase the salary to 5000 dirhams.
What have you left in it? The best thing you will do is to leave and we will get rid of you!
Get ready bro, the poor wants to become president
This is not sincere, they just want us to vote for them in the elections of 2015. No, we have uncovered you!
Take your story and go! You're the last one to talk about Islam!
May God support the truth!
I want a job.
I am looking for a job.
May God help you!
Anapec, if you want us to work, go away!
May God rest their souls in peace, God willing!
May God rest their souls in peace!
Firstly, he is immoral and disobeys God and His messenger. He must repent and fear God the Almighty. We shouldn't seek advice from someone like him as God the Almighty says if they perform prayer and pay Zakat, they are your brothers in religion.
It is true, you're right!
Benflis and his group wanted to sow dissent in Algeria. That's why the people didn't want to take the risk and chose stability. There can be no development without stability. This is what we see in brotherly Arab countries and the so-called Arab Spring. The result was paid by the people alone.
Exalted be God! My brother, we're Muslims and governed by the sharia of Islam. Normally, these people should be punished according to the Islamic sharia and anyone who incites this crime and moral depravity.
There are no terrorists. The state is the terrorists!
Fighting language, they want to see who will believe them!
I would like to address my thanks to national security services and tell them may God help you and Tunisia is a trust in your hands! God willing, God will protect you!
Salam. I hope from God to restore your health and wellness! I hope from God Libya be free, free, free of mercenaries. God grants success!!
Stop lies and calumnies o apostates!
These are driving by the hand of Israel which is ruling them with a remote control. If you are men, Israel would entice you with its money.
hhhhhh., very learned! You should be teaching in Oxford! You have understood it alone!
It is better you keep quiet and stop talking nonsense. We don't want anything any more from the state. We are helping each other and living thanks to God!
Yes, we young people love religion, we love to have a Muslim country.
We hope there will be real Islamic banks not just by name.
Well-done great protectors of Tunisia, God willing, God will drive terrorists away from Tunisia and protect it!
Well-done, by God security for everyone!
Well-done great protectors of Tunisia! God willing, you will be victorious heroes!
They are right, ANEN.
May God help you!
We support you and always pray for you God willing God will support you! God willing always victorious! We rely on God and on you to protect our country.
The nicest greeting to Tunisia, its people and Tunisian army! Viva the army! Viva the army, bless you!
May God guide them!
Whether it's a lie or a truth, the most important is that this is not jihad. Jihad doesn't mean killing your Muslim brother. Everyone should mind his own affairs.
Only God knows if what you're saying is true or false.
ISIS and terrorist factions are a Zionist organisation serving the state of Zionists and Zionism. These are true statements. This is what all our sons should know. Syria has its men. You can support it by organising your countries against corruption. Address mafia Zionist gangs in your countries!
There is no God but Allah, Mohamed is the messenger of God.
Terrorism is marginalization, humiliation and injustice in this country. Review your accounts!
True words.
May God reward you with good!
Your statements are true and going to Syria is like going to death.
O Moroccan people, Bashar al-Assad is a hero. The war in Syria is just a conspiracy in favour of the Zionist entity. All this is intended to make people forget dear Palestine.
Yes, yes my brother. You're right because the one who dies in Palestine will go directly to paradise.
First of all, viva my country! However, there is one thing, fear God, this country needs men who will work hard for their tombs not for their pockets! Thank you
Because you can't do it, it's my job and I know it.
We love you Bouteflika!
Moroccans are degrading by God!
We haven't seen anything.
Where has the money of the people gone?
We've not seen anything, lies!
There is no terrorism in the country. It's the authority.
Victims of terrorism have the priority. All their demands are little. Viva ANP!
All Algerians don't have a right in their country like me. I am a victim of terrorism. In addition, my father was a policeman, may God rest his soul in peace! But when I submitted a file to A.O.P in the police, the service of terrorism victims, they told me there was no right. The one who died, his place has gone anyway. The country is cartoonish
No justice for me
Yes, my brother Hamza, there are many like you. They gave me nothing. They don't know we're living or dead. True my brother, we the humiliated people have our Lord. By God, they will pay before God the Almighty.
Well-done Kafon! You have uncovered their papers!
My brother, a very nice song. All Tunisians like it. We're waiting for you in a new look or a new song.
Extremism is the enemy of all humanity. God alone kills whom He wills.
Why don't they appoint Sellal?
what you did is nice!
This is Haram, Aziz, don't be eaten by fire, which will torture his uncle Weld Dedw.
We love you, we love, we love you president! We won't substitute you Bouteflika! May God grant you long life!
This is logical.
There is no Ebola in Israel.
No comment! Loss is our way in our country. Always there is no solution in Morocco. Is there a solution for immigration please?
Only the solution of armed revolution is left.
Now girls work more than boys.
May God find a solution for us and for all the unemployed people!
You have found a job in cables, someone found nowhere to work.
Thank God our country is good! As our king said, they envy us for it. Thank God, I work in cables. I work hard, pay water, electricity bills, rental and housework. Thank God, we are comfortable in our country. Thank God, that's why they envy us for the comfort in which we live.
You won't do anything to Tunisia, ok!
May God protect Tunisia!
Words of Zarrouk about the people (don't rely on the people), his words are all wrong. The people are everything o Zarrouk, ignoramus!
7,200 is too much! if this how it is, I am selling my house at 6,500 dirhams a meter.
Peace of God be upon you! If you don't mind, I would like to know more details about this project. For example, do people enroll in order to benefit or what exactly? May God reward you with good!
Salam. We must think of the poor, may God help them! 7,200 dirhams is too much!
It is too expensive at 7,200.
If they implement their Finance Law 2014 on tourists, whether Algerians or others, may God help you Tunisia! God willing, we will go to Morocco or Spain.
Offer us Ansej at five billions and reduce fines!
God willing, always happy and at ease! Tunisia is one of the most beautiful countries. Tunisia is dear to us. We all love it so much. It's our mother.
Too much, man you killed us with lies! You're no longer trustworthy!
They are fooling the people! They want a revolution to erupt in this country and ruin everything! They say 7,200 dhs!
He is lying, the one who says they increased 1000 dirhams. They haven't added a single dirham to the retired.
7,200 dhs, are you dreaming or are you fooling us? There are people who have a salary of 1,000 dirhams a month and want them to buy at 7,2000 a meter!
You did nothing! 7,200 a meter is too much. You are encouraging banks and interests. This is too much. This is not good. It is better you invest these funds in major projects and offer jobs to people with good salaries, control working conditions and encourage rural areas.
This is too much for the poor. Is there nothing affordable for the poor?
We must kill terrorism.
We must find jobs to be the best country in the world. We want to stay in our countries.
I am Algerian. Viva Algeria! May God rest the souls of soldiers in peace!
May God protect for us Mohamed 6!
There is no God but Allah, Mohamed is the messenger of God!
May God bring the welfare of the Islamic Umma!
I don't know when but they shouldn't be participatory.
"Islam began as a something strange and it will return to being strange, so blessed are the strangers."
Tunisia relies on its men and men come face to face.
No, this border don't need to be opened. They will start to pose with vegetables here! Leave them in the sand they have there!
We have a government called "Baesh". It has starved us and stripped us of our clothes. If Daesh comes on top of this, it is better for us to buy a shroud and wait for the death angel.
Strength, there is nothing like Morocco.
Kill them before they proliferate!
No, no, no, no, no to opening the border! Let Algerian be eaten by lice! O world, We don't want the border to be opened !
I am against terrorists because victims have no right. It is a shame that someone from the east of Algeria doesn't have the pride of Boumediene.
Enough, stop lies!
It seems to me you're fooling us!
I am Zahira from Casablanca. I have a master 2 in purchase and international trade. I haven't found any job. By God, this is a shame! Wherever I go, they say if you have no recommendation from someone influential, don't dream of getting a job. My father is just a poor man. We don't know anyone. My poor father worked hard so that I would get a job and help him. Now he is the one who helps me to live. Please help me if you can!
This government thinks only about itself. O Lord take revenge! The Moroccan people are lost. The government is good only at price hikes. As for considering jobs for young people, hhhh, no! May God reform things!
If you want honesty, die for your country and defend it because it is the one which will always be there for you. The homeland and the king, this is what we have.
This is not allowed in our country.
May God grant long life to our king Mohamed 6!
May God support you!
You have worn us out with speeches, we have seen nothing, just words and speeches breaking our heads!
We won in 91, how do you want us to trust you? They don't like Islam. If they answer this question, you will understand everything. Do you love money or not? Do you love children or not? Do you love death or not? When they answer you, you will understand everything.
May God rest their souls in peace! They are soldiers of God. May God offer them paradise!
May God protect our country!
Jihad is one of the pillars of Islam which we won't give up for Zionists and their agents! I spit on every cheap person!
One of those protecting Tunisian borders.
Nonsense! We don't trust such anonymous organizations! Tunisia is doing well. Let Tunisia live in peace o enemies of Tunisia!
Nonsense! Tunisia is fine, let it live in peace!
Ali Belhadj is the most suitable.
Your rulers are just like you!
The most important is that we won't study.
This government will only be content when they are done aggravating the people and we fall in what happened in Tunisia and elsewhere.
The government is working very hard even better than former governments. As for the funds, it's the governments of Jettou and El Fassi that have ruined them. These unions just want to fool people. Have some shame, may God guide you!
I would like to work in the army. I used to work in it for two years, there were still many requirements. I am no longer in it. I would like to go back. I call upon the defence minister to make my wish true. I would like to join army units specializing in artillery in Sbeitla. I would like to serve as I can confront terrorism. I support the Tunisian army. Greetings.
God bless security men!
O country, as did Bouteflika, everyone is eyeing t he country!
God willing, God will bring all the good!
You must be a cheikh!
This is true. This is what happens in Syria. My cousin has gone to Syria for jihad but he was shocked with a different reality. He wanted to come back to Morocco but they didn't let him come back until he was wounded and they let him down because his wound was severe. But they told us a charity man took him to a refugee camp in Turkey. But he died on the day when his family went there. From God we are and to God we shall return.
If anyone seeks jihad, he should lead jihad for his parents. Jihad is here in Morocco brothers, why go to countries' of other people?
His statements are true. We refer them to God. My brother went there and was arrested. Now we're paying the high price. Anyway, God's curse on those who were behind this. The victims are parents. If anyone wants jihad, he should lead jihad for himself and for his parents. O young people, what this young man says is true. Be careful, be careful, if you want jihad, real jihad is for your family!
All this is lies and unfounded!
We hope the situation of the country will be adjusted God willing and they will grant all the people their rights.
In the name of God the most gracious the most merciful. We Algerian young people thank all members of national gendarmes. They managed to eliminate different networks. Wish you success!
1, 2, 3 viva Algeria!
May God bring all the good!
The people must contributed to helping the security in fighting this big scourge. May God protect us!
This is a shame! We're brothers, why should be hostile to each other? These people need civil police!
What they do is haram, by God!
Shame on them!
You're just scaring us.
In Algeria, rights are for terrorism not terrorism victims. Cartoonish country!
I would like to enlist in the army, I have no acquaintances to back me.
Shame on them!
They are killing us with looting! We are just seeking security or a quake! You know, with you, we will never make it out!
Whom of you speaks and implements what he says and who implements and speaks? Everyone sees that his opinion is the solution. Therefore, this only makes things worse.
hahahahahahahahaha, there are a lot of mean people here! Enough meanness! Wake up my brothers, enough my brothers! Who is the Moujahid who never shot a bullet? Guess?
True!
With you Bouteflika to death!
Very nice!
The biggest mistake committed by Morocco is that it hasn't examined carefully Aissa Hayato when he came to the country to detect Ebola.
We want the border to be reopened!
I apologize my brother, I don't know.
Thank god your name is Fatma. By God, say this word again before God!
May God not guide the wrongdoers! May God support the right against injustice!
Oh, my God! This is too much! This means that after two years I too won't work!
Where is unemployment pay? O electronic armies of Benkirane, analysis is a topic requiring field research and comparing the phenomenon with other developed countries for example France, America or the Turkish model.
Honestly, now nothing! Women work more than men. Now for example, Europe which has preceded us by some 1000 years haven't done what you're doing in this country. There, they do 50-50. Here, they wish they could make 100% of women work. O Lord this is enormous! I would like to ask you if there is someone in this government who stigmatized about men. From the day they began, they are only good at talking about women. By God, people are busy to address unemployment and they are busy with the affairs of women. May God rest the soul of this country in peace. Thank you!
The government is disconnected. It doesn't want to serve the Moroccan people.
This doesn't work.
The scourge of housing, may God guide us and you! Is 7,200 dirhams a suitable price? So, we should go and steal! This is a shame and disgrace on you!
I hope it will be very soon.
I want information about middle-class housing 7200.
My father doesn't earn 7,200 dirhams for the whole year!
There is something weird in this story. It's something. Viva Tunisia!
God willing, you will do what you say even if it's him.
No right is lost and he asked for it.
The best way to deal with him is to welcome him. He is Tunisian, he can die in his country. People act and God rewards.
May God protect Abounaim, may God support him over the pigs who fight Islam of monotheism! He will remain despite disbelievers, irreligious and Zionists!
There is just sickness in this country! They should consider the poor class. There are those who work only for a living, so how can they have savings?
They say affordable price 576,000, they are shameless. As they have suffocated young people, may God suffocate them from their smallest to their highest. 80 meters= 576,000. Hhhh, they're fooling the people!
hhhhhhhhhhhhhh 7,200, these are higher! Nothing has changed hhh! They ask what the naked need, they say a ring! They want to drown Moroccans more in debts!
7,200 dirhams is too much! Morocco isn't just limited to Casa, Rabat, Tangier and Marrakesh. Look towards the south-east, people are very prejudiced. It also seems to me that these papers talk only about these regions. Go down to the region of Bouanane and neighbouring areas, you will find families made up of 12 individuals and only one member of it works or no one works. The region is very poor. Look also at the region of Anagfo. This a shame and disgrace! You talk about Morocco and talk only about three cities. O Lord this is enormous!
720 dirhams, I will take one or even two!
Fear God! Hell is hot and you're very close to it!
Salam. God, the homeland and the king. The best country in the Arab world. I like Morocco. There are more rich than poor. It is the country of security. It is nice. I have seen all Arab countries, I haven't seen any like Morocco. Even in Europe, life is not the same, I haven't seen any. I married in Marrakesh in 2007.
May God guide you and rest the souls of martyrs in peace!
Islam is a religion of moderation. The messenger of God has talked about these events and said some heads will emerge so kill them!
God will take care of anyone who wants to challenge, wish evil and sadness to our white Algeria. May God rest the souls of all those who sacrificed their souls and everything dear! God is the greatest!
We didn't have a house for more than 20 years. Our parents died in a slum. I call on his excellency the president to solve this problem. I am Algerian. I have the right to a house.
Don't fight your Muslim brothers!
Viva Algerian army! May God rest the souls of soldiers!
If you need me, Kenitra. Fear should be of God not people like me!
Religion has become politics for you. Originally this party doesn't fear God. Fear God! God's curses on the devil who disobeys God!
Yes!
We wish to have an Islamic bank. We hope they will set it up.
Thank God!
We always hear statements and the following day we hear different things. Who should we believe? I don't know.
Our motto as Moroccans is God, the homeland and king! There is no difference between us from Tangier to Lagouira.
All Tangier is mixed up with fibbers and Salafists. What you said is true.
The problem is with the mindsets.
What will happen after 17/04/2014? May God help our country, o Lord, amen!
May God protect our country, o Lord! Enough of this rule!
God is astonished about you.
Sir, everyone is free about his folks!
You're all Libyans, fear God o Muslims!
Viva Bouteflika and Sellal in spite of those who don't like us! Viva Algeria and the meeting on 17/04/2014. Thank you!
Dogs of the marines!
What a creature!
Congratulations Mr Bouteflika. I congratulate the president Bouteflika the most beautiful president who brought out Algeria from scourges, difficulties, mafia, debts and humiliation. Algeria has gained fame in the eyes of the whole world today. Welcome Bouteflika in the fourth mandate in spite of the enviers, the anarchists and mercenaries!
God is the greatest!
Viva Algeria! May God rest the souls of martyrs!
God bless you! You have honoured Algeria. This is good!
Look at what happens in Gaza!
God is sufficient for us and He is the best disposer of affairs against Khwarej! They have ruined Islam and Muslims. They kill people of Islam and leave pagans!
I am against terrorism law because terrorism law is repression of the Arab peoples. Therefore, I reject its implementation.
Truly, once they come back to Tunisia they should be imprisoned for life! These are not normal people.
Now I would like to know one thing. Isn't the blood of a Muslim forbidden for another Muslim? By God, I no longer know who of them is right.
Exalted be God! In Gaza, our brothers die every day and we are still exchanging accusations. As the people are hypocrite, the right has become falsehood and falsehood has become the right.
Salam. By God, I don't understand where things are heading to. May God protect us and bring all the good. Everything is welcome as well as poverty, hhh!
The Islamic Salvation Front is Moujahid.
Rule is to God, the One and Prevailing!
May God protect us from this!
Bouteflika deserves to run. Why do you refuse o people? Bouteflika has been absent for two years and we didn't feel that we were without president.
Bouteflika is a man who deserves to be a candidate.
Death rather than Benflis!
O Lord protect Tunisia and our men! By God, if they accept me as a guard and give me arms, I will go with our brothers. This is a wish I have from all my heart.
May God rest them all in peace!
May God rest their souls in peace! They all died as soldiers on earth. They are rather soldiers of God. From God we are and to God we shall return. On Friday, there will be the funeral prayer for the absent, God willing!
May God rest their souls in peace!
May God rest their souls in peace! Viva the national popular army!
May God rest the souls of all martyrs!
To hell!!!! Add Hamas again in the opposition and they are the system itself! Didn't they make an alliance in 1999? In addition, they sold FIS in 1991? There is no one more vicious than Hamas!
We understood nothing!
You're right! He is brazen! He will vote for a terrorist like him!
God is the greatest!
They aren't Muslims, they are rather terrorism! God's curse on them!
May God bring all the good!
All these are lies!
God willing, the most important thing is that our countries remains high whether it is Bouteflika, Benflis or Hamrouch! God willing we will remain fine!
May God bring all the good!
Enough lentils and beans!!!!!
This is all lies, when the cow falls, there are many thieves.
About this, there is no power but from God! The poor and needy people want to earn a living by stealing. God exists!
Blessed Friday to Mohamed 6 and all Moroccans from Kénitra to Sraghna!
May God help you men! May God protect us, o Lord!
May God bring all the good!
May God protect our country and our men!
Post something new!
May God grant Tunisia victory !
Security is everything!
Jihad is the five compulsory prayers, fasting and righteous acts. Thanks!
May God heal you! Enough insults!
Thanks for your advice to our youth!
But in Palestine there is no Ferdaous paradise? Or is there a doctrinal religious disagreement?
Because paradise is waiting for you!
Corruption is the government. As regard the people, they hardly earn a living if they manage to!
God bless your words!
Go to sleep far away in your land, this is the land of Amazighs!
All terrorism victims have a right. But now, it is criminals who have everything.
We need acts not words. We wish success from God.
Viva Algeria!
I am Sayad m. Mohamed. I call upon the Algerian people not to vote until they reform conditions. We do our duty but there are no rights. When will the country be reformed? In 2050? This is too much! Anyone who comes says I will serve the people. When he secures his place, he grills the people!
Salutations to the national popular army! We don't need any comment, they are real men! Be Algerian or die trying!
Are they going to build plants close to these cities so that we can pay this sum of money? May God reward you with good!
Now we are causing shame to this state again!
You Libyans take milk, vegetables and food from Tunisia and allege Tunisia isn't helping you. You were starving. In addition, we are suffering from cattle which have entered Tunisia. Enough my uncle, if you have studies, you wouldn't have gone through all this. Most of you are ignorant and those who have studied have fled Libya to Britain, Italy and America. May God reduce the ignorance you're enduring!
Salam. Anyone who wants a fourth mandate for Bouteflika is materialist and secularist who wants to kill all the constituents of the people.
Non, we don't need criminals to come to our country and spoil it!
Shame on you! You're fooling us! God is the greatest! Your hour will come!
Hhhh! Add this 20% to 15.4% and 4.6%, you will find all Moroccans unemployed. The only ones who work are ministers and parliamentarians under the slogan a minister for every citizen!
Salam. This African Cup should be held.
The health of people is better than football. Originally, the ball is inflated only with air! We should first see people who support it. Their health first.
Every Moroccan is aspiring to this moment.
Is this social housing or high-standing because it is 7,2000 m2? So nice!
Now we are in secular swirl when the word of truth is called radicalism! Now the heretics are good people and scholars are radical and Takfirirst. Zionist media 100%!
In this way, Fafa will be happy with you! One hundred thirty-two years and still standing. You see who is the enemy. God is sufficient for us and He is the best disposer of affairs!
My children are starving o rulers of Tunisia!
Unemployed to increase income.
The day when you will live in Morocco, say these statements. You went to Libya, so stay in your Libya! We Moroccans accept our king. There are good and bad things, thank God!
O Lord protect us from apparent and hidden discords!
May God bring all the good!
Kamel Zarouk is not killing the people, he is rather liberating them from tyrants.
May God support them!
May God support them!
May God protect our country from these people!
Are you stupid to support tyrants? They want to rule the countries with laws for which God has not sent down any authority. Enough ignorance! Say may God support Islam and Muslims!
May God help you men!
The slogan of Morocco is God, the homeland and the king.
hhh, everyone is lying! It is a play. By God there is nothing. Soldiers died, this is unacceptable.
We don't have anything and want nothing.
Are you fooling people? We don't have money and have studied. But there is nothing, no jobs and nothing!
May God guide them o Lord!
By God the greatest, I am tired of too many statements! We have only statements, nothing in practice!
Imagine with me that we had a factory and a house in four storeys and 3 shops. When my father died, everything was sold. The family was big now it's all dispersed. Everyone has taken his way. I remained alone with my mother. I ask anyone who reads this message to consider our situation. I don't care about myself. I have spent my life. All I care about is. I live in Alhrawyin. I hope to get some job.
By God my brothers, my daughters won't be able to celebrate the Eid. Who is this benefactor who will bring them joy? ,,,
How many unemployed people do we have in one year? We haven't even offered employment to a point percent. During the era of Hassan II, may God rest his soul in peace, he said in a speech we would add about 30000 jobs. 2000 jobs only.
For me, I think he should bring back his money and invest it for the interest of the country.
For me, I think he should return his money to the state.
The price is too high!
It doesn't even deserve 2,000 dirhams, hhh!
May God rest the souls of your parents in peace open an Islamic bank! It is a shame that Morocco doesn't have any. I would like to take a loan for my house in about one year, I hope they will be opened by then. This is because if I disobey God, how will I meet Him? And how to do to buy a house? I hope you will feel the sufferings of the people.
This is an unjust sentence against him.
O people, fear God! Don't give us hopes then lie to the people. Just help yourselves if this is the price! It is suitable for you because anyone of you will at least take three apartments. As regard the middle-class, even 3,000 dirhams is too much for it!
God bless you!
God is the greatest!
O Lord support Muslims!
May God help you!
I hope this is true. But they should have discussed it a long time ago. But now, it's too late.
We're men and we will die as men. This is the feature of Algerians.
It is the state which is killing in Algeria. There is a side you can charge that with. There is no terrorism in Algeria. But terrorism is that you're still eating. But God exists.
Hi! God's curse on anyone who offends Mohamed, peace and blessings of God be upon him.
God willing, may God make it a success, we need it so much!
Salam. I have one question. Is the mujahid called terrorist?! Are zawiyas which will prevent terrorism from spreading? We say to this Zian go and read a little about the religion of Islam which is the religion of moderation. As Muslims, it's our duty to be conservative by following the Qur'an and Sunna. These are our sources not zawiyas. This is top of backwardness. What I will say is enough disfiguring the truth. What this Zian said is considered extremism in itself.
O Lord support true Islam. In the name of God the most gracious the most merciful. "They want to extinguish the light of Allah with their mouths, but Allah refuses except to perfect His light, although the disbelievers dislike it."
Have some shame o ungrateful! Are you happy with what happens in Tunisia, Egypt, Syria and Iraq? Leave us in peace, our country is fine, don't destroy it, don't make it as it was in 1999! This is Algeria, protect it! By God, the day will come when you will regret speaking! April 17, 2014 is coming, so show to other countries you're one hand!
May God show the truth!
Tell your sister to remove everything and go take vitamins!
Indecent still complaining! God is watching. They say bikini!
O swim in drugs between you and Your Lord, ok!
This individual is mentally ill, don't mind what he says! He will recover, but this will take a long time. But even he recovers, he will recover with a defect.
God willing, God will support the national army!
God bless you!
God bless you!
God bless you my brother!
Salam. My brother, what astonishes me, and by God widen your minds, I am from the rebel groups and how revolution took the way towards specific goals. What happened is that data have changed. Those who opened their breasts to bullets, gas and were tortured are forgotten. A group of criminals and market dogs emerged and now they control the country. Those who fought and are hiding have become the speaking hernia. We forgot the poor people, now we have become terrorism. Misery, poverty and concerns have increased. They took us back 100 years. Like the one who said he found the city was empty or going and there was no one. They are good at speaking, explaining and analysing!
I hope this is true and will contribute to reducing unemployment in this country.
This is the serious thing.
I have been working in sewing for a man for one year and half. He never granted me a leave. What should I do?
May God help the brothers in Libya!
I don't agree with this analysis. You should talk about the value received by the worker in this prison.
May God protect president Bouteflika!
Zero to the left, out Benkirane!
What's the fate of jobless young people?
In these times, anyone who wants to demand his right from a company, believe me, he will go to prison even if he has witnesses. Any official in this country who wants to know, let him come to me to know.
We wish Morocco our dear homeland will move ahead! God, the homeland and king. Viva the people!
May God rest their souls in peace and forgive them!
May God rest their soul and introduce them to paradise, o Lord!
Bless you, may God help you!
May God rest their souls in peace!
May God heal Bouteflika! We Algerians say yes to Sellal because we see in him all competencies and loyalty during the sickness of the president. He is present with us. Viva Bouteflika and viva Sellal!
You're right young girl, these statements are too much.
O Lord bring good things!
By God, let Tunisia be in peace, enough lies o opposition of change not true opposition! By God, enough calumnies, ok! Wake up about your situation Tunisians. Salam. Ramzi.
Whom are you going to wage jihad against?
1, 2, 3 viva Algeria! We will take it, ok!
Thanks to the Tunisian army! I will sacrifice my soul to Tunisia! When I am talking about Tunisia, there are tears in my eyes for my love to it and its dear soil. May God protect you Tunisia, dear Tunisia!
I want Tunisia to return as it was. We are very tired, ruined and worried at the same time. May God help you and protect you men of Tunisia!
Tunisia is strong with its men.
Never Ali Belhadj!
This is a cartoon country! There is nothing!
May God help them God willing! God willing Bouteflika will win! We love him so much!
Good!
May God protect us!
We're tired of terrorism!
Thank God, I wish my son came back, even if they put him in prison, it's not a problem. The most important is to see him, but he is dead. May God rest his soul in peace!
This happens in the USA! Don't forget you're in Algeria!
God bless Halilhodzic! God willing the next coach will bring us the African Cup!
God willing, the national team will follow the same way which it made in Brazil in the African Cup 2015 by not changing players!
Viva Algeria!
Wish you success and well-done!
May God rest the soul of Bouteflika! He was living in the past, now he should let heroes rule!
Yes, we support you! Anyone who isn't happy with this should blow himself up in the toilet!
May God help them!
God willing, they will increase the salary, we're very poor!
It can succeed brothers, may God grant you success!
May God help you, amen!
May God help them all year. It is all a lie, this people only want misery and arguments.
I support opening the border.
To hell with Rahoui, Ellouz and others! You have sickened us, you made us hate our clothes as if you are the sons of the eagle! Even the eagle isn't like you, Just forget about them
Rahoui is an apostate. Man, do we hide the sun with a sieve? This man is Leninist Marxist, i.e. he is one of the biggest enemies of God and His prophet in Tunisia. His classmates at university know him. Moreover, Rahoui during the era of Ben Ali was a senior employee in a bank. His affairs were good. He spends his holiday in the summer, he drinks alcohol, sings and doesn't care about anything. Now he has become a rebel defending the people!
Mongi Rahwi, may God help you!
We're in a country where everyone is spying on the other. The day when everyone will mind his own business, then everyone will see his own defects.
This gossiper deserves this! In this way he will learn in future what to say. Our dear politics require a little seriousness. There are anyway limits to lies!
All this is done by the immoral who are only good at sinning. O Lord we ask for your satisfaction! Pray for the blessing of the prophet all of you!
They are all the same. But the people are useless because they are like cattle. They are watching and listening while other do what they want. But thank God there is our king. He won't spare anyone who falls in his hands including many of them from Benkirane to the last one in the government.
This is not permissible because our Mauritanian society is conservative and no such thing should happen in our environment because this is not permissible in Islam although in the era of modernity and developed civilization, this is allowed. However, everyone has his opinion. This is my personal opinion. Thank you!
The state is terrorism!
Salam. By God and the words of Imam Malek, you would say as if it's not from Islam! My brother, since you love democracy, everyone is free in what he wears.
If only you take care of concerns and corruption coming from tourism, it would have been better. The one who wants to ban Niqab must remove rottenness from his mind. Is this an Islamic country?
I support increasing the minimum wage. Certainly, this decision is necessary.
God willing!
We call upon all the brothers in Ghardaia to reconcile and forgive. Sedition is worse than killing.
Our country Algeria is founded and holds on to its moderate religion. This shouldn't be forgotten. Therefore, reconciliation is better.
O Lord reconcile Muslims!
Thank God we have security and safety. You won't find anyone like our king.
I am Moroccan. There is no Islam in this country. The commander of believers lets his wife naked. If the ruler is corrupt, the people will be corrupt.
I swear by God, if they come to destroy our country and kill us wrongfully, we will be on the lookout God willing!
May God keep away from us evil people! We love our country and king.
If they can come in, let them come in, they're welcome, we Moroccans are very proud.
May God guide His creatures!
God willing, they will be victorious, may God help them to eliminate terrorism!
May God protect you! God willing you will score 3-0 against Russia. 1, 2, 3 viva Algeria!
We must play on the attack with Slimani and Brahimi, God willing, we will win!
I want Djabou to be in tomorrow's line-up.
God willing, Mahdi Mostafa won't play! 1, 2, 3 viva Algeria!
Djabou is Messi of Arabs.
This price is too much for us!
This price is very high and for Europe it's very low.
True, the price is very high. It's not at all affordable for the average Moroccan. Find a solution!
When you offer 7200 dirhams a meter, who will live there? Rich people, as for us, we don't even have roads. Come to see people in Alwahda dam, the road we have is the one built by France. So stop fooling us!
We hope this is true. This is what we want.
Enough lying and fooling!
This is good. But what should the one who has no degree do? I hope this plan will be comprehensive and cover all all Moroccan young people.
I am unemployed. Since the formation of our respectable government, I see that this unemployment rate is not going to drop as long as we haven't implemented our principles and respected legal regulations.
We want a job.
You killed us with promises!
But in a different way.
O Lord support our religion Islam. We don't know where the truth is. O Lord support the truth against the falsehood!
There is nothing without reason. If they want to launch them, they would have done it a long time ago as there are some clauses that aren't clear about Mourabaha as there are many conditions that neither the traditional or Islamic banks can meet. There are hidden things they don't want to show as they are just seeking profits. Thank you!
Thank you very much even if it's late.
People who can pay 7,200 dirhams a square meter already have a house and need nothing. You should consider the labour class which is poor and want even 10 meters where to sleep with their families. The government of the end of times! You're fooling people! God will reward everyone for his acts. By God, this is a shame! Now all the people are seeking social housing and can't find any let alone 7,200 dirhams!
"If you support Allah , He will support you and plant firmly your feet." We need so much an individual who has the courage of Abounaim. Our situation in the Islamic World isn't good. Personally, I am not happy with the condition of Moroccans as regard both the material and moral.
Is this a social or high-standing housing as the price is 7,200 dirhams?
Salam. We want Islamic banks, ok. Thank you! God banned usury and authorized sale. It's good to do them and let us all benefit.
We're waiting impatiently, when will these banks begin?
The problem isn't in the lack of jobs. There are jobs but you need 5 millions if you want to work. This is because even jobs are sold. An employment agreement is paid with money or "your father is my friend, he recommended you to me", or money even the military or any other job. If you go to a company, you do training for six months. Then they tell you go till we call you.
Study, learn, do training and in the end rest, this is your job in this happy country. May God guide these people! Traitors of this country do projects to their sons, while people die in poverty. You're the son of this person, go ahead, you the son of this individual, move backward because your father has nothing.
We hope there will be all the good with this new law of 2015. We have diplomas.
Salam alikum. My dear brothers, I would like to know if I can work in this field.
Is the one who works for 3000 a week, is he considered working?
You work 23 months then they bring someone else in your place to work for the same period and so on. The policy of Jews!
Viva national Algerian army! There should be alert and caution from all sides. Viva Algeria!
May God rest the souls of Algerian soldiers! May God protect the national army!
Amen! O Lord protect our country from all evil!
Glory and eternity to our martyrs! Viva Algeria!
Salam. Every individual has the right to criticise anything except the dear prophet Mohamed, peace and blessings of God be upon him. He must rot in prison. Thank you!
Salam. May God protect us! Hopefully it will be the first and last, peace, reconciliation, old people, problem on television. May God protect us! God answers the prayer! Ahmed.
We are an Islamic country and need an Islamic bank.
I don't know why Ras Jedir in particular? Ok
With zatla people will grow up idiots. Beware of zatla!
Not Zalta! The people will be backward and idiots. Beware of using zatla! This will result in ruined people.
You have made a fuss about the reporter and forgot what Christians had done in Tunisia and Algeria for 130 years. They killed Muslims mercilessly and raped their women.
You are frying potatoes and it is the poor who pays the price! It is ok, you have divided the country. You have sold the Sahara. One thing you can do is to leave us in peace, enough!
We're here. Daesh is a fictitious name, we're Algeria, ok, we're here!
I don't know much about politics. But what I know is that if everyone imposes his opinion by force, there will be a chaos and we will go back to the nineties. I hope everyone will put his mind in his head. We're all Algerians. We say congratulations to the one who will win, like today, like tomorrow, we will be one hand so that we won't give an opportunity to the countries which will be served by it if Algeria falls in chaos.
My brother, the human being, my brother... The article talks about co-existence and openness and other things. And you're concerned only about your Ghardaia! Show some openness!
This is something very good because this is the problem of young people. When all these things are provided, many things are lacking. This is the right thing.
These words are nice but in practice, there is something different, hhh!
I am looking for a job.
I want to work. I am tired of unemployment. May God reward you with good!
We want to work.
We hope this is true.
I have a diploma in dell and in aluminium.
The chameleon below the earth.
This is good.
O Lord this is a vice!
A question to the government: are National Promotion workers not part of the working class? For how long will this marginalization last?
I would like to know who small employees are and where they are. Haven't they said everyone will be integrated in the scale? This is madness!
Words on paper only!
This is frustration not pay hike!
We haven't received any pay rise. It is always 2500 dirhams. We didn't benefit from the first hike. We in technical inspection are very oppressed.
You are clowns and we don't want you among us because you are hypocrites! Algeria is an Arab Muslim country.
You are only seeking chaos! We don't want you among us.
Yes to opening the border!
Any opinion can be given about what happens in Sahara. It's an issue external to Algeria.
This move is recorded in favour of our Algerian brothers.
Algerians are just lazy but the border will always remain. They are starving and want to eat but Morocco was doing a favour to them although if you do a favour to a dog, it will remember it, but them, impossible.
What's this?
This is very good!
God willing, o Lord, we are brothers and Muslims.
Everyone sings the songs that suits him.
No, on the contrary, this is not true. Tunisia is protecting its country while you are digging for something you don't know. But if you come to work in the army or the ministry of the interior, you would have known that Tunisia is exerting its efforts in a very intense way to protect the Tunisian citizen and its borders from anything be it big or small.
Tunisia is fine. Everything is a lie! Our police is the strongest in the world! It is true they lack resources. But we are strong in our minds. God willing, we are fine, and we will fight everything difficult. Viva Tunisia in spite of enemies and hardships!
No to sedition, yes to reform, progress and development!
Give me break, is smuggling now part of terrorism! One works in lethal smuggling and becomes terrorist! God willing, Tunisia will be sent by Ennahda group, now Tunisia will be fine, it is you who have ruined Tunisia!
Bring back Ben Ali and everything will be fine. God willing, Tunisia will always be fine!
O servants of God, we want to work in anything but didn't find a job. But those who are in front of the parliament who want jobs in the public service should know that in a country where you can't find a job even in construction, it is clear even for the blind, it is impossible to have a job in the public service.
hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh, this a normal lie, I defy you if anyone works!
Salam alikum.
HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH, there is no power but from God the greatest!
I don't care about anything. This sharia, I tell them one thing, enough! Because you and terrorism. Tunisia has its men and God the highest is with them.
You no longer understand anything! There is one thing I understand. The end of life is close and the signs are beginning to appear. We believe in God.
O Lord support Tunisia and people of Tunisia! O Lord grant patience to the Umma of Mohamed for all the martyrs of Tunisia!
May God protect Tunisia from dogs and preserve for us security and army, God willing!
Hh, the media of disgrace? Is this right by God? Who granted you the licence to open such papers? Was it not Ben Ali?? They kept on lying to the people and glorifying his achievements while he was ruining the country as if he were... here they are still lying! I don't give up my reason before or now.
What about one hundred in the army?
Viva DRS Algerian! I wish I were with them.
Libya free!
God is most powerful! We Arabs have many fools!
I like it.
In the name of God. Increasing hours of Islamic education is in reality the nicest decision adopted by the country. Congratulations to pupils and Mauritanians. Peace of God be upon Mohamed and his family.
Bless the channel and bless the man who runs it!
We just hope.
Everything said by this man is lies and lies. This is because I was there not in jihad but as volunteer with some Turkish guys from Gazintap. We went to help people with the Turkish Red Crescent. We've seen Moroccans in the free army and have seen other Mujahids in many fractions. Honestly, they seemed to me to be happy with what they were doing. May God guide everyone! I am not encouraging jihad. I have just said what I have seen with my eyes.
May God grant you prosperity and reform your country our brothers! Congratulations, you should thank God as the mercy of God is wide!
Interesting information, thank you!
There is no future in this country. Open the border and let's go out! Enough!
God willing o Lord! We wish all the good and security.
May God help you and support you!
Isn't he the one who took us out of the crisis? May God grant Bouteflika long life and heal him!
Only what God decides will happen. May God support men wherever they are!
Thieves and liars! We are tired of this, wish you wellness!
Please let us know If there is an entry exam!
I love you Algeria!
Concerning the crossing Machhad Saleh since you are protesting and on a hunger-strike to open it. Dhiba crossing is the only one which should be extended to be commercial. Is Dhiba not part of the country? Is it not part of Tunisia?
God bless you Muslim! You see this word you said, we want you to repeat it before God! God is sufficient for me and He is the best disposer of affairs!
I haven't seen in this what we always see in Lembediyate. There is nothing in this.
Aren't you ashamed to give false info? You alleged that all terrorists have run away wearing Niqab! May God take revenge on you debauchees!
This song is inciting the Mauritanian society to insult religion and people.
Salam alikum. I agree that Niqab is a religious freedom and exists in the sharia. It was decreed by God for the spouses of the noble prophet so that they wouldn't be subject to any harm or to avoid temptation. Any woman who wants to wear it is free following the way of the spouses of the noble prophet. So please, respect this opinion!
Does this mean if a criminal is disguised as police officer we will ban the uniform of the police? I wear Niqab, but I have no objection if they want to check my identity. I am a Tunisian woman and worried about my country from terrorism. But I don't accept that they restrict my freedom.
God willing, he will rule with justice and unite all Algerians, amen!
May God support the truth in our country and all the Umma of Mohamed, peace and blessings of God be upon him!
I hope they will withdraw the case.
True my brother!
From God we are and to God we shall return!
God willing, we will win and be the first team to honour Arabs! 1, 2, 3 viva Algeria!
Now explain to me, you talk about mountains and military zones, you arrest terrorists in Tadhamoun neighbourhood. Tell me how do you find addresses in Chaambi? Or are you lying to us?
This news of discord in Tunisia. What happens is all a film. Many idiots, animals with their long ears believe the tyrants!
Viva Algeria! Viva Oued Souf! May God protect Mbolhi!
May God help you, God willing, protect you from evil, return to your home safe, you're the future of Tunisia!
God willing, victory over Germany 3.0!
Good, but why bring Yebda, pff!
We must keep Hallilozich because the team is small and he gave it dynamism of strong play. God wiling, the coming is nicer!
When will it be opened in Kénitra? We hope this move will be sped up as it will be blessed by God.
Do European countries merge with Gulf banks?
I am a victim of Moukawalati program. They bought for me the equipment without the raw material. What would I do with equipment? They told us to pay back the double of the initial amount including interests and the installment. When it was impossible to find a solution, they sentenced us to prison and seizure. They said the law doesn't protect dupes. So this one as well is going to do like what Abbas Fassi did, may God forgive him in this blessed month! As for Benkirane, he implemented law on us. I leave it for you, without comment.
We wish this to be true. There are young people addicted to drugs as there is nothing to do. This should be done as soon as possible because Moroccan young people are deprived of many rights.
Lies!!!!
It will never happen
There are still men, may God protect you!
We have a great army.
We are impatiently waiting for these banks.
Hhhhhhh 7,200 dhs, these Moroccans are brazen!
We hope to have Islamic banks in our country instead of these interest banks which exhausted our budgets.
In this case, it is more expensive than social housing. The citizen needs a flat at 3,000 dirhams a meter not 7,200 dirhams.
We need Islamic banks.
It is too expensive. Are they fooling us? No one has money to buy even a meter at this price, this is madness!
Salam. Honestly, this project is nice because the middle-class lives a very miserable life. This project will improve their conditions because they are suffering more. But this price is too much for them. In a few words, I know many poor people who work day and night to buy a house, but this price is too much for them.
In this regard, we will be relieved. Let's be honest, the social housing is in our interest. The state is offering a solution from 25,000 dirhams which becomes 41,000 dirhams through the bank. I forgot to add that you have to travel to get to the house! Everything is considered easy by this state. They are killing us with rhetoric!
Just a bunch of robbers! We are jobless while the minister takes MAD 70,000! May God take revenge!
His majesty should intervene for us. Young people are lost, I swear. There are too many graduates who are jobless. Favouritism has ruined the country. Like now, most police officers have joined the service thanks to their acquaintances and they left young people who have degrees.
We want to work.
O people, we want to work, enough words! We're fed up with unemployment.
Lies, lies, lies, Moroccans to death!
May God bring all the good! Our country is good. It is true there are many wolves, may God protect us!
In the name of God the most gracious the most merciful. A call to the minister of urbanization. We call upon you to act with responsibility in order to implement this housing project intended for the middle-class while securing a guarantee for the buyer and strike with an iron hand anyone who doesn't do his duty. Thank you!
Bouteflika doesn't know what he's doing. Enough, he is old. He has worked and reformed the country, this is true. But, now, it's enough. There should be change. It is like a player who plays well on a pitch. But when he is tired, we should make a change.
Bouteflika is dead and you want to vote for him. May God guide you people, the trembler!
May God guide you guys! The people can't even find money to buy a loaf of bread to eat it and the plan costs 7200 dirhams. May God take revenge on you! God, before God, we will take our right. Nabil Elalami from Tandit, Outat Elhaj.
We will confront any terrorist who tries to disrupt our security and our religion. Viva Tunisia! Law is above all!
By God, you're terrorism o traitors!
Good luck!
You haven't seen the exploitation of TV.
Salam everyone. There is no power and no will but from God. Morocco was forced by law to commit the sin of usury for years. They did this forcibly not voluntarily. We hope this news is true; otherwise it will add to the failures of the government which needs an iron grip to implement its projects. It is God Whose help is sought!
Yes, we want this type of banks.
These interest banks get their transactions from the central bank, Bank Al Maghreb, which is an interest bank.
When and in which year?
I am looking forward to its launch, this makes one happy. May God guide you for the good!
Thank you!
May God help you with this project which we need so much!
There is no power but from God!
Shame on the state to make such a decision! If retirement age is raised, what's left for ambitious young people who are still looking for job opportunities? I think that raising retirement age will increase unemployment. There will also emerge many social phenomena which will constitute a heavy burden for the state. Personally, as a university graduate, I have been looking for a job for one year. Now, I am beginning to feel boredom in my country, think of leaving it and never come back again this is because our opportunities were eliminated by 99%.
hh Benkirane doesn't want to go away from his position, that's why has made this increase, hhh!
May God guide everyone! As Kafon said, law was crippled.
Anyone who negotiates with SISI is a killer, ISIS and Ennahda supporter. Woe and woe, ruin and loss to rulers who don't observe any pact of kinship or covenant of protection!
May God send us a ruler who is good for the country and people!
Shame on you! May God guide you!
This annoyment of Algerians, especially for me as man, I think it's normal. Moreover, decency is good because I think that woman who doesn't cover herself isn't covering her husband. This doctor who is annoyed about people who look at her, tell her consider God Who is watching you o filthy one!
God bless you! I too, if only I could become a star in Bolywoood or Hollywood!
Chakib, you're immoral and uneducated. Have some shame! This is Ramadan o dog!
May God rest their souls in peace and bestow patience on their families!
You didn't lie.
We don't even get 2333! We don't have the old SMIG or the new SMIG. I hope there will be rigour in implementation.
In spite of this, it is not enough.
Hypocrites! There is no hike and nothing. They're just lying to the people. Originally, the minimum wage is 2000 dirhams and they say 2800 dirhams. May God protect us from you bunch of thieves!
Yes for change for young people!
May God grant you bounties, leave us in peace!
He is a devil, may God humiliate him! He is still turning.
Spit on you!!! This man must feel ashamed because he is a butcher!
God is the greatest!
May God protect our country!
To talk about this issue about which politician opinions disagree for some hidden reason, to talk about the issues of employment, it is necessary to make a social study. This means a study of society and number of job seekers in particular the unemployed people whose numbers are increasing annually. I would also like to draw attention to the readers to the statement of the minister who said that the unemployment rate was dropping, I don't agree with this. Unemployment is on the rise as long as there is a quick demographic growth. Therefore, we hope the current or next government would adopt an efficient policy to help unemployed young people. The future will show us what will happen.
There are no jobs in Morocco.
So introduce them to Moukawalati programme to experience in turn psychological stress. Fill courts with Moukawalati cases!
Liars and hypocrites! May God send you torture, amen my Lord!
I hope this will be true not just false lies.
We believe in God, everything is in the hands of God.
Viva green Tunisia!
God willing, may God protect our country! God willing these dogs won't control us and won't have the opportunity to control us!
I love Tunisia, wish you all the good, you're in my blood!
Viva Tunisia!
God willing, God will support our country! God willing, these dogs won't control us and can't control us!
You're right my brother. We are enduring with the housing issue so much. There is no project for this marginalized town.
Amin, the security forces of Tunisia are like a roll, they play on two cords. There is something not normal in this story. O Tunisians, wake up for yourselves!
All these are lies! There is something not normal in this story. Why are they all dead? Terrorism doesn't act in this way. Where is Abou Iyadh? Why have news about him stopped? Even this is a lie. Forget Tunisia because who'll resurrect 7 people.
May God help you!
By my father's head, these terrorists have driven us crazy!
Bless you for the manliness!
A salutation to every security officer who serves the country with conscience, fear God, and defend the country! God willing God will support you!
Is it possible? Is it possible, Nooo! May God forgive them!
Logical statements which can be taken into consideration. Authorities should release him as he regrets it.
All this is intended to deter people from going to Syria. Maybe this El Melihi hasn't been there. I think he has just gone to some mountain and came back to say nonsense. O Lord support our Mujahid brothers in Syria.
Great because this is the reality you shouldn't run away from. This is the truth. This is the reality of Syria and other countries which are infighting for fighting only. As for the biggest jihad, it's jihad of the soul.
May God bring all the good, God willing, for this country! Men have died for this country!
May God bring the welfare of this country, God willing!
May God protect them!
God willing, God will guide our security and everyone who serve our country and secure the stability and tranquillity. May God illuminate them!
May God protect Algeria, o Lord!
We hope to be friends and spare us dissent!
Anyone who hears this would think that they really sold the country a long time ago and won't leave it.
This is not respectable.
The country can host them, Mauritania won't lose.
Wellness and bliss for the country! Enough, my brother you saw what happened in 1990! If you want change, you should go on April 17.
1, 2, 3, viva Algeria! Shame on you, you are brothers!
Why do we put on trial an individual who accused of apostasy an individual and party? On the other hand, they didn't react towards those who seized Ceuta and Mellilla, and we glorify those who usurped our country during colonization.
O Lord this is enormous Mr Lachgar!
Anyone who bans what was authorized by God, authorizes what was banned by God is an apostate. The right thing is the Book of God and Sunna of the messenger of God Mohamed, peace and blessings of God be upon him. As the prophet of God said, the covenant between us and them is prayer. Anyone who abandons has disbelieved. Religion is advice. We will all die and will be held accountable. From God we are and to God we shall return. Praise be to God Lord of the worlds!
Why stirring sedition? Fear God in us!
O Lord support them!
May God protect you men of Tunisia! I wish I could work in the army.
May God support them!
May God support the truth, amen!
The bleary-eyed said I would believe only what I have in my hand because I no longer believe anyone.
There are terrorists elements who don't wear a beard and long shirt. They can't be distinguished, they're from Ansar al-Sharia and jihad wings. They follow the moves of the Tunisian army.
By God, it's all lies!
May God help us!
Morocco is a special case. No one can get close to it because there are men who are ready to fight with darts from the top of mountains to defend our king Mohamed 6.
This is the tax of revolution! So drink from the cup of freedom! May God rest the soul of Kadhafi in peace!
Great and you will always be great my best singer Bilal! Bless you!
Bilal is the top of rai!
Bilal, we love you so much! I hail from Guelma, they send you their greetings. Working and always working!
Something great Cheb Bilal!
Great and smart Cheb Bilal!
Work my brother!
You can dream!
You in Sahara without Morocco you will eat tiny stones!
hhhhhhhhhhhhhh they arrested him just because he has insulted that secularist party which has been sucking our blood ever since we came to life in this dear homeland! They didn't investigate about that big belly who wanted to appear like a scholar and talk about equality but our judiciary has nothing to do with the right! We let go those who daily insult Islam and put on trial this man we don't know! I watched his video and I tell him God bless you!
This statement by Sheikh Abounaim against Mr Lachgar wasn't expected. He must adjust his concept.
May God grant success and make things easy!
God bless you! You will work well with the bank!
7,200 dirhams is too much!
What you are talking about isn't a decrease in prices. Honestly, although I don't live in the north, I live in Laayoune, we too want solutions in Laayoune. There are people who have lands in Laayoune but don't have money to build on them. Do you have any solutions?
Social houses in Al Houceima are sold at 22 millions cash in Al Omrane. This is not reasonable! Anyone who has 22 millions can buy a land and build a house at half this price. You are fooling people, hhhh!
I love Algeria, may God rest the souls of the ones who died!
This 7200 dirhams isn't for the middle-class. It is for the filthy class of rascals! O Lord this is enormous! You don't do anything to satisfy these people!
Whether you vote or not, it's the same!
7200 dirhams is too much!
My poor friend died with them. May God rest his soul and rest the souls of all those who died!
May God bring all the good!
The army is strong and the people free, always proud unlike some people who kiss hands!
May God help you army!
It seems you are rich since you say 5,000 dirhams! Sir, 3,500 dirhams is too much for the people of the neighborhood, you should take into consideration poor people!
May God rest the souls of duty martyrs!
May God not bless him! These are Kharijites!
I am not with terrorism but I am with Ansar Al-Sharia.
This article is about the man who offended the messenger. It is true. On Sunday, when they were questioning him, he couldn't speak.
Everything said is lies! Abou Ayounb is a kind person and is known for his good manners.
Thank you very much and may God rest the souls of your parents in peace for this idea which makes us satisfy God. O Lord bless it! We needed so much this project. I thank you once more.
God willing the welfare and peace of the Arab Maghreb and all the world, o Lord!
Our Morocco is nice, may God protect it for us, amen!
Are Muslim countries free of what you have previously said? Or is this limited to Morocco? Is your country free of such phenomena such as prostitution, alcohol and other things?
Thank you!
In reality, all Moroccan people need these Islamic banks. We say to usury banks, stop theft, you have ruined us!
What's the relation between "to hell" and "thank God"?
God's curse on anyone who cuts the throat of someone!
ISIS doesn't scare us!
It's as if killing our brothers is normal but when Al Fath came, God willing, it's not normal. Viva ISIS!
This is an act of cowards.
May God protect the homeland!
First of all, there should be consultation with those concerned, conduct a survey covering those who are about to go on retirement. It's noteworthy that most Moroccans work to the age of 61 especially those who were born before 60 because they don't have an exact date of birth and you calculate for them 31 December instead of 1st January. There are some Moroccans, especially from rural areas, who don't have an exact date of birth. There are some who reduced over 3 years of their age.
God is sufficient for me. You fool the people! How can he live 65 years in the conditions you provide for him? God is sufficient for me! Make God take revenge on you!
Why? The age of 55 is enough! What about the unemployed, should they stay jobless?
Words of politics, of manipulation. Go, may God burn you!
We Moroccans are dangerous and more intelligent than you! There is no ISIS, no nonsense, no politics and nothing! If they implement the Islamic State, why do they want to come back to Morocco? They should go on in their way from there to Israel. We the Moroccan people would come and help you eliminate the Zionists firstly. O Zionist, o Israel, o ISIS that called Israel, it wants to live, it raised the flag of there is no other God but Allah and says Islamic State! It wants to confuse us. We Moroccans don't trust. I hail from the Rif, sons of Abdelkrim Khattabi. O ISIS, if you want to come to Morocco, we're ready for you, you're welcome. You're Islamist or Zionist, we don't care, the most important is that we're Moroccans, a true Muslim state. Praise be to God, God is the greatest, thank God! Salam alikum.
Authorities agents are also covered by this programme.
Salam. The talk I read can be implemented in internal regions for a salary which has the minimum wage of 2800 dirhams and became 3000 dirhams. As for the Sahara, there is no law and nothing. You work hard and get a few cents. I work for 2000 dirhams a month. A taxi takes you for 10 dirhams. This means 40 dirhams a day. Only 960 dirhams is left. What would that do for me while my husband hasn't found a job yet? He works very hard during the day and gets 80 or 100 dirhams, not always, just 2 or 3 times a week. Is this life? We just want to go back to our home town but we couldn't afford expenses and we have a young baby. We thank God for everything.
My brothers, salam alikum. Everyone wants to serve his country. Everyone wants to work and be well off. This is our concern. Add one more concern and pray God to relieve our Syrian brothers.
Is this the hike they made? It seems we should help them with all the wage and work for free then see if they will complain. 110 dirhams ====&gt; 5%.
Viva Algeria!
I am fed up with misery. It's true my country is nice even if I eat stones.
God is the greatest, o apostates!
O God, make me believe this!
Shame on you! You're killing us slowly. Some have committed suicide because of unemployment. Others became mad because of unemployment. Some went abroad, others want to immigrate illegally and died because of unemployment. Some are living abroad away from their parents because of unemployment. I am one of them. I am living alone in Saudi Arabia without any relative or friend except God. This is because of unemployment. I have a degrees in informatics, graphics, cooking and pastry. By God, I haven't found any job! Shame on you. I swear to God that I live abroad and work in Saudi Arabia as pastry chef for 4000 Moroccan dirhams. Isn't this a shame? If I have found even 2500 dirhams in my country, I would have thanked God for it. However, traitors haven't left anything for us. We refer you to God as He is capable of taking revenge on you on behalf of the people of Morocco.
Bless you, with all these degrees still you can't find a job! I think the problem lies in you. Are you looking for a job with the state? Otherwise, only with informatics and design you can work in a cyber café and earn an income but you're sitting home. May God help you!
These are just words and we stop here. We hope there will be something.
Aah, the government doesn't have the Staff of Moses. But for how long has it been planing? The meaning is clear!!
We're not lambs and you're not butchers. We are the responsibility and you are robbing officials!
May God rest the soul of Boumediene in peace! That's all I can say.
Hhhhhhhh, may God damn you liar!
Jihad between Muslims isn't acceptable. However, you've all followed the statements of the media. The Moroccan regime as well is playing cards. It follows Americans so that they would say Muslim young people are terrorists. Who says this is true? Everyone lies. If I had an opportunity to go for jihad in Palestine, I would have gone. This man believed in an idea, a salutation to him. He told me the truth if this is true. Morocco is the field of lies and hypocrisy.
God bless you security services of Tunisia!
(expletive)
The ministry of religious affairs is a ministry which is still loyal to Ben Ali like the ministry of the interior. Therefore, we aren't surprised at their involvement in fighting Islamists. There is a coup project, the features of which are been developed. It is led by the criminal left and the companion on the way the Rally party. From God we are and to God we shall return. The West is happy with this government. Therefore, there will be no elections. This is a permanent government.
This Mr Aroui is the spokesman of Ben Ali and his system. Imams who were removed after revolution are all Imams loyal to the Rally party. To sum up, the ministry of the interior has become a heavy burden on the revolution and it should be monitored closely. Moreover, the security unions should also be dismantled as they represent a parallel security serving left and Rally parties.
May God help them!
Stop lies, you're terrorism!
May God protect Algeria from these rascals! We are all against these bastards!
Salam. Bouteflika must stay forever no matter what happens!
Viva Bouteflika!
Ehh, I don't know what you did for this country. It is riding on austerity.
Well-done, this is the right thing to say!
Establishing the Arab Maghreb Union is also necessary as it has many benefits including the economic, cultural and political. Integration between Maghreb people might remove political crises between Arab Maghreb people and make union between us which will be difficult to break. I am against closing the border. Anyone who encourages closing the border is unfortunately a slave, accepts humiliation, has no dignity and is backward!
God is the greatest, Bouteflika!
God willing, the power of God is with us!
He must, must bring in Brahimi. We deserve him.
Brahimi must, must play in the attack. We deserve him.
O Lord protect them
God willing, Jabo will join the game.
Viva the sons of my country! Viva Algerians! I love them! Well-done! God willing we will defeat Russia, God willing
My brothers, you have confused me and puzzled me! May God rest the soul of our dead people and dead people of Muslims! There is no God but Allah, Mohamed is the messenger of God!
By God, if you come to Morocco, by God, you will...
I am Fatima. I would like to register in the forum because I love Algiers.
Bilal, people in the past said ants eat ants and the rest is left wandering. The wise understands. I say may God bring all the good!
This individual doesn't plough, by God we won't sell him. We took him to the market and didn't get any good price. The Algerian is a nice person known for his nobility. People know him to eat meat and throws the bone. He doesn't wear what the people wore and whatever he touches, he adds value to it.
A nice site!
You're doing something good Bilal!
I love Morocco. God willing, the border will be opened and we will become one people and face the same fate.
By God, I like you as artist. But you shouldn't put your head in this well. You people are seeking to save money in travelling through the border but don't consider scourges coming to us from there. So I will stay alone.
I don't agree with you Bilal.
Anyone who wants to be hostile to Morocco must be sure he will be hostile to himself because we Moroccans have dignity and won't allow anyone, never, to come close to our country. We're waiting!
Reasonable, you said something good.
Morocco is ready to fight terrorists!
Now, why all this? May God support our king Mohamed!
hhhh, viva Morocco! If they want war, we're ready for them. God is the greatest!
Anyone who wants to come may come, anyone who envies the tranquillity in which we live, we refer him to God!
O Lord support Islam and Muslims!
This has become very serious for our people.
What do they want from us? These aren't Muslim, these are Jews!
For this issue, authorities must review the call of socialists to change the order of God. This reflects a western sedition.
The government must intervene with anyone who offends sanctities of Islam especially Qur'an. We should on the contrary seek to implement everything revealed in the Qur'an not desert it and change it. God will preserve His Book. "Indeed, it is We who sent down the Qur'an and indeed, We will be its guardian."
Morocco needs more cooperation to fight terrorism. This might threaten the security and stability of the country.
Salam. May God support you my brother!
Shame on you my brother! Remember that interest rates are banned and were prohibited by God the Almighty, and you encourage Muslims to commit this sin. Thank you!
Are you fooling us? Is this the price intended for the middle-class? This price is available even now. You are just fooling the people! It will increase if you add the bank interest, hhh!
Give us arms so that if we die, we will die standing on our feet not bowing! Give us arms, what's ISIS?
Our house is with God in paradise!
This is not the middle-class, this is humiliation 7,200 a meter! God is sufficient for me and He is the best disposer of affairs!
Mr Benkirane is fooling the people! He did what he wants. He says he is at the service of the people. They killed us with rhetoric and we haven't seen anything! Bunch of thieves!
We hope this will be true as many Moroccans can't buy a house because of interest banks. We hope this tree will bear its fruits in Morocco.
May God guide them on us!
All these are lies! For you it is cheap and normal. What about the poor who also has the right to housing, health and education how can he pay you when the state should pay him with its budget a house and medicine? You should first equip your hospitals then talk about the new era! You should provide the simplest medicines for the poor and needy people. Where are the poor who have chronic diseases such as HBV and HCV? People need the help of the state to provide them with medicine. Or do you hide and cover these things? But everyone knows this. You provide medical care and housing for you and comfort for your children. You are saturated. We are fed up with your play. This is one of the reasons why young people boycott elections. There will be total boycott, no one of the young people will vote. We will drive a campaign against elections to raise the awareness of young people not to vote so that the truth will come out as it is very clear. You just have to understand yourselves and your leaders!
The one who commits such hideous act, how can he run away with it? The army hasn't fallen yet. The one who will make it fall isn't yet born! You have earned their guild, enough!
We thank Bouteflika who removed terrorism.
Viva Bouteflika! We support you till death. God willing, God will heal you! O Lord protect him for us! We will support you to the last minute.
Viva us!
Viva Algeria!
O Lord support our country!
We hope this will be good omen for this country.
In the name of God the most gracious the most merciful. You can't do this. It is the interest rate that attracts customers even if it is usury, but the economy is based on such transactions.
May God help them and defeat their enemies!
We want these banks to be established very soon.
I hate the terrorists and I sympathize with the victims, may God have mercy upon all of you. I want to ask God to send those who did this to hell forever as they are infidels. I love Muslims, and I hate those who do not believe in God, even if they do not know Him. I ask God for forgiveness.
God is Greater!
May God help you, Ibtiha.
Well this is quite an article, for real
I seek God's help against them.
The hero was a true patriot who loves his homeland.
She is wonderful and her video is also good. Nadine is wonderful and her voice is sweet.

Allah is sufficient for us, and He is our Protector.
I love Amal Hegazy and am waiting for your new album impatiently.
May God mislead and take revenge upon them. What is this poor little girl guilty of? I ask God to provide her family with patience. What a shame!
This is a good channel.
Soccer.
I seek God's help against them. O God! Protect this world from evil. I swear we do not deserve what is happening to us. God is the Greatest.
Honestly, this is a good work. Well done.
There is no power except with God the Almighty. Bring something to eat and do not anger us . I swear this is prohibited.
Hamam has one of the best voices in the Arab world. His voice is soft, sensitive, wonderful and indescribably beautiful. He is endowed with physical and spiritual beauty. In my opinion, Hamam has the best voice ever. I am Silvana and I adore Hamam.
There is no God but God. He is the only helper.
Long live Iraq. May Allah protect the Iraqi police force. Allah is the Greatest, and victory will be to Iraq.
When will the bloodshed in Iraq stop? I seek God's help against them.
God willing, the day will come when we will stop writing about injured people and terrorists. We want to write about happy occasions. Enough with death!
I love this songstress very much. She is elegant and beautiful.
Allah… O Iraq.
Thanks!
O Arabs! You have learned from the foreigners to kidnap the daughters of Kisra and then kill them. May God curse you.
There is none worthy of worship but God. May He destroy them!
Good.
Hello and greetings! I work as a medical emergency technician in Tehran Emergency [Center]. I would like to work in your healthcare system. Please kindly answer me. Thanks!
I swear this article horrified me and by God, I do not know what to say to the father or the son. May God guide this son and bestow long and happy life upon the father. I swear that this is a very difficult father-son situation. May God help this father, save his son, and guide him to stop the crimes that he is committing.
Salaams… I am an Arab named Adras from Syria. Bab Al-Harah TV Series is good
Those criminals are inhumane, and they are beasts. They must die! I seek God's help against them. As of the victims, I ask God to provide their families with patience.
There is no power except with God the Almighty. I seek God's help against these criminals.
May God have mercy upon them, and we ask God to take revenge upon the oppressors. Please, be patient may God give us all long lives. We belong to God the Almighty and to Him we shall return.
Naya is very beautiful and her song is wonderful. Her voice is delightful. I love you very much Naya.
I am a goalkeeper. I was born on 07/19/1889. I want to join the team. I live in Morocco, and I would like to get into the experience. If you are not interested in me, I will return to my country, and if my level is good, I will be willing to stay on the team.
I really like this useful channel.
Most election lists do not have names on the website. Why?!
What should we do? This is life! Be patient and God will facilitate your affairs. Take care of each other, because the future will be better!
